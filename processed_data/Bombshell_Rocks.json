roads\nI've got Mommy's Little Monster in the headphones\nIt keeps me warm I stay out of the cold\n\nI'm catching speed\nI never gonna stop again\n\nHave you ever had the feeling\nNo one can bring you down?\nWell today I feel unstoppable\nAccompanied by that explosive sound\n\nStrike a chords it's like an arrow through my heart\nWell I was caught as the first note got hit\nCome down the air is electrified\nSee how we get our kicks\n\nI've got the feeling\nNo one can bring me down\nYou see today I feel unstoppable\nI'm heading down the same old roads of my hometown\n\n", "album": {"title":

go\n\nWhat about everything we did?\nEverything we did was it just a game?\nCan't take this pride\nCan't take this pride and replace it with shame\n\nIt's just that sometimes I feel lost\nI feel so alone, I feel so incomplete\nI feel like breaking out\nOut of the cold into the heat\nWhat if what's bitter could be sweet\n\n", "album": {"title": "From_Here_And_On_(2003)&&2595", "genre": "",
