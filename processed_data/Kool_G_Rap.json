this game, sometimes it makes you wanna holler\nIt's a damn shame, what I gotta do just to make a dollar\nLiving in this game, sometimes it makes you wanna holler\n\nI got a fly hoe up under the wing, a swinger that does her thing\nAnd if you step inside my ring, she'll bang it out and make your brains hang\nShe sits at restaurant tables with mink foxes and sables\nDrinkin' Cherenade brand label she'll rock a sucker's cradle\nAnd yeah, honey is more bounce to the ounce\nShe walks around with lucci in large amounts\nMillions inside Swiss bank accounts\nHer name is Tammy, got a beach house in Miami\nRides around with a small jammy in her silk and satin panties\nA down hoe, a Foxy Brown hoe, standin her ground hoe\nAnd if you clown yo she'll turn into a bust a round hoe\nFly as a Heaven's Angel got sapphires in her bangles\nDiamond earrings hangin' dingle gettin' money from all angles\nShe's pretty under the New York city bright lights\nAnd real light, way after midnight, I hit it cause the slit's tight\nWake up early and make my rounds, break up break down\nPackin a silver four pound, some clowns be trying to get down\nLight up a smoke and grab a stack of C-notes\nThem slick
