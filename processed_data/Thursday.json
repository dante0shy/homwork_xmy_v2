difference \nWhere I start and where you end\nOr if you sit in an emergency aisle\n\nWe could be dead, complete the equation\nOur names are X and N\nWe have no value in these calculations\n\nWe're placed on a plane pointed straight down\nTraveling at five hundred feet per second\nFive thousand feet from the ground\n\nHow long will it take us to hit?\nHow fast till we start the disintegration?\n\nNo time left - just keep moving\nNo time left - just keep moving\n\nHow long will it take us to hit?\nHow fast till we start the disintegration?\n\nWe could be safe here, forever\nFalling in the clean blue air\nSomewhere between the sun that gives us light\nAnd the ground that puts it out\n\nWe'll kneel in the aisle,\nPress our hands together\nClose our eyes and speak these words \nSo softly to the black box\nAnd it goes:\n\n\"Mother, father can you hear this? \nI want to thank you for all the sweetness but\nI'm not coming home, we're never coming home\"\n\n",
