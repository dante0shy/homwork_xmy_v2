the chorus\nWe're writing songs the world can\nShout out loud\n\nLend me your voice, sing it\nLouder, I can't hear it\nLend me your voice, sing it\nLouder, I can't hear it\n\nI'm looking back on all those long days\nWhen I was just a kid without a care\nYou asked what could I have to say\nAnd I replied, \"you're listening to it here\"\nFlashbacks are force of habit\nWhen we were just some kids without a care\nThe living room we used to practice\nThe songs that you're listening\nTo right here\n\nLend me your voice, sing it\nLouder, I can't hear it\nLend me your voice, sing it\nLouder, I can't hear it\n\nMy head's a mess it's waiting to unfold\nMy head's a mess I'm waiting to unfold\nWould you listen to me?\nWould you listen to me?\nMy head's a mess it's waiting to unfold\nMy head's a
