can't see an enemy you can't define\nThey're gonna urge you to God and country, they're gonna urge you to cross picket lines\nAnd while the trading is free far overseas, they're retouching borders we're all chained behind\n\nRevolution is unfinished\nThere won't be peace until there's justice\nI've got my home-made bombs, homespun charms\nI'll meet you at the corner of Skid Row\n\n", "album":
