high\nWell, I can't remember every word He said\nWhen I'm standing here just looking through the air\nAnd I can't forget the times they've gone away\nWell I'm gathering the source and You're the way\n\n", "album": {"title": "I_Am_An_Elastic_Firecracker_(1995)&&5272", "genre": "Post-Grunge", "year": 1995}}, {"title": "Miles And Miles Of Pain", "href": "Miles_And_Miles_Of_Pain&&5089", "artist":
