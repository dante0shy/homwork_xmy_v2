ear\nYou're a word in my mind\nI'm here on my own\nJust two of a kind\nTogether alone\nTogether alone\n\nYou share in my deepest secrets\nYou're here in my darkest moment\nTogether alone\nTogether alone\n\nYou know what I'm always thinking\nYou lift my mood when I'm sinking\nTogether alone\nTogether alone\n\nWhen you're here in my arms\nI'm dreaming of you\nLife will end when I stop\nBelieving in you\nTogether alone\nTogether alone\n\nYou're like a shadow\nAt the edge of my eye\nLike a chill in the air\nLike a light in the sky\nLike the endless peace after we die\n\nYou're a breath in my ear\nYou're a word in my mind\nI'm here on my own\nJust two of a kind\nTogether alone\nTogether alone\n\nI don't need anybody\nI don't want anybody\nI'm on my own\nTogether alone\n\nNobody can understand us\nNobody to make demands on us\nTogether alone\nTogether alone\n\nAnd as the bombs are falling\nI hear a voice that's calling\nTogether alone\nTogether alone\n\nYou're a breath in my
