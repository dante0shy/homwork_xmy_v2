grasses \nAnd you told me how forever \nWould soon be \nAnd we walked a while \nAnd stood for hours without reason \nTalking of what was it like? \nBut to take down walls \nAnd never build them back \nCould only leave this place in me behind \n\nAnd if you give me one more day \nThen I would gladly say \nWhat love has come my way? \n\nAnd struck a chord that rested \nBringing out the sun and moonly lights \nAnd I still look out \nOver these distant acres \nWhere I bury hope \n\nBut there must be another way \nTo hold these gates \nOpen for us \nThere where the days go fate \n\nBut for one more day \nThen we might hold these gates \nOpen for us, for you\n\n", "album": {"title": "Still_Water_(2002)&&9316", "genre": "", "year": 2002}}, {"title": "Daylight", "href": "Daylight&&8178",
