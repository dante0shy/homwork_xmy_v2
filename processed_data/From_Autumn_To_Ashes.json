For all the amateurs that you've\nKnelt before.\nBreaks my mind in two.\nThey surrounds us.\nOne more night without you.\nThey surrounds us.\nTake my will with you.\nThey surrounds us.\nBreak my mind into...\n\nOne, breathe in to be free\nTwo more time and you'll see\nThree, it will numb all the pain\nHow hard is it to be sane?\n\nWon our will to be seen\nRaise our hands and we'll scream\nSpeak your mind and you'll see\nWhat it is like to free\n\nOne breather in to be free\nTwo more times and you'll see\nThree it will numb all the pain\nHow hard is it to be sane?\n\n", "album": {"title": "Abandon_Your_Friends_(2005)&&4731", "genre": "Metalcore", "year": 2005}}]
