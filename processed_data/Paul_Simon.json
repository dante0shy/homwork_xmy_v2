graduation\nI am picking up a bogus degree\nThat's me\nEarly me\nThat's me\n\nWell, I never cared much for money\nAnd money never cared for me\nI was more like a landlocked sailor\nSearching for the emerald sea\nJust searching for the emerald sea, boys\nSearching for the sea\n\nOh, my God\nFirst love opens like a flower\nA black bear running through the forest light\nHolds me in her sight and her power\nBut tricky skies, your eyes are true\nThe future is beauty and sorrow\nStill, I wish that we could runaway and live the life we used to\nIf just for tonight and tomorrow\n\nI am walking up the face of the mountain\nCounting every step I climb\nRemembering the names of the constellations\nForgotten is a long, long time\nThat's me\nI'm in the valley of twilight\nNow I'm on the continental shelf\nThat's me\nI'm answering a question\nI am asking of myself\n\nThat's me\nThat's me\n\n", "album": {"title": "Surprise_(2006)&&6663", "genre": "Rock", "year": 2006}}, {"title": "You're Kind",

good\nYou're so good\n\nWhy you don't treat me like\nThe other humans do\nIs just a mystery to me\nIt gets me agitated when I think that\nYou're gonna love me now indefinitely\n\nSo goodbye, goodbye\nI'm gonna leave you now\nAnd here's the reason why\nI like to sleep with the window open\nAnd you keep the window closed\n\nSo goodbye\nGoodbye\nGoodbye\n\n", "album": {"title":
