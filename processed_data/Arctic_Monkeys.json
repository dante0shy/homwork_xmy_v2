have to say 'owt\nShe's in the stance ready to get picked up\nBet she's delighted when she sees him\nPulling in and giving her the eye\nBecause she must be fucking freezing\nScantily clad beneath the clear night sky\nIt don't stop in the winter, no\n\nAnd they said it changes when the sun goes down\nYeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down\nAnd they said it changes when the sun goes down around here\n\nThey said it changes when the sun goes down\nOver the river going out of town\nAnd they said it changes when the sun goes down around here\nAround here\n\nWhat a scummy man\nJust give him half a chance\nI bet he'll rob you if he can\nCan see it in his eyes that he's got a nasty plan\nI hope you're not involved at all\n\n", "album": {"title":
