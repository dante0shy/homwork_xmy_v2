Their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world, obscured as it was by great clouds. Here they played out their peaceful lives, innocent of the litany of excess and violence that was growing in the world below. To live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough. Then one day Strangefolk arrived in the town. They came in camouflage, hidden behind dark glasses. No one noticed them: they only saw shadows. You see, without the Truth of the Eyes, the Happyfolk were blind.\n\nFalling out of aeroplanes and hiding out in holes\nWaiting for the sunset to come, people going home\nJump out from behind them and shoot them in the head\nNow everybody's dancing the dance of the dead\nThe dance of the dead\nThe dance of the dead\n\nIn time, the Strangefolk found their way into the higher reaches of the mountain, and it was there that they found the caves of unimaginable Sincerity and Beauty. By chance, they stumbled upon the place where all good souls come to rest. The Strangefolk, they coveted the jewels in these caves above all things, and soon they began to mine the mountain, its rich seam fueling the chaos of their own world. Meanwhile, down in the town, the Happyfolk slept restlessly, their dreams invaded by shadowy figures digging away at their souls. Every day, people would wake and stare at the mountain. Why was it bringing darkness into their lives? And as the Strangefolk mined deeper and deeper into the mountain, holes began to appear, bringing with them a cold and bitter wind that chilled the very soul of the Monkey. For the first time, the Happyfolk felt fearful for, they knew that soon the Monkey would stir from its deep sleep. Then there came a sound. Distant first, it grew into castrophany so immense it could be heard far away in space. There were no screams. There was no time. The mountain called Monkey had spoken. There was only fire. And then, nothing.\n\nOh, a little town in U.S.A\nThe time has come to see\nThere's nothing you believe you are\nBut where were you when it all came down on me\nDid you come in now?\n\n", "album": {"title": "Demon_Days_(2005)&&3848", "genre": "Art Pop", "year": 2005}}, {"title": "Kids with Guns", "href": "Kids_With_Guns&&6048", "artist": {"unique_name": "Gorillaz"}, "lyrics": "Kids with guns\nKids with guns\nTaking over\nBut it won't be long\nThey're mesmerized\nSkeletons\nKids with guns\nKids with guns\nEasy does it, easy does it, they've got something to say \"no\" to\n\nDrinking out <i>(push it, push it real)</i>\nPacifier <i>(push it, push it real)</i>\nVicious souls <i>(push it, push it real)</i>\nStreet desire <i>(push it, push it real)</i>\nDoesn't make sense to <i>(push it, push it real)</i>\nBut it won't be long <i>(push it, push it real)</i>\nKids with guns\nKids with guns\nEasy does it, easy does it, they've got something to say \"no\" to\n\nAnd they're turning us into monsters\nTurning us into fire\nTurning us into monsters\nIt's all desire\nIt's all desire\nIt's all desire\n\nDrinking out\nPacifier\nSinking souls\nThere you are\nDoesn't make side to\nBut it won't be long\nCause kids with guns\nKids with guns\nEasy does it, easy does it, they've got something to say \"no\" to\n\nAnd they're turning us into monsters\nTurning us into fire\nTurning us into monsters\nIt's all desire\nIt's all desire\nIt's all desire\n\nPush it real, push it, <i>(it's real)</i> is this real?
