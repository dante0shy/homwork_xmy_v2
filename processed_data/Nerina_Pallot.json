least, I did, but now I'm not so sure,\nNothing's in its place, nothing's certain anymore,\nBirds fly, trees sway, why can't I be like that?\nHappy knowing what I am, in fact and leaving be?\nBut truth has been obscured,\nI am only human and I'm always wanting... more.\n\nOh, the world is a place and they say it's on our side,\nBut I wonder, is there comfort in those moments when we die?\nNow I see, Mr. King, that was in the books you gave me,\nWhich I read, disbelieving, thinking poets are depressed,\nOh, Mr. King, I have changed, I confess.\n\nOh, those good days I remember well:\nTape on windows, wintertime was hell,\nBut it was fun, and people there were kind,\nThere was good work to be done, and I learnt to think my time.\n\nAnd the world was a good place, and in days were where I lived,\nI imagined life had purpose and I'd something good to give,\nMr. Cave played along on the battered hallway piano,\nOh, every love song a secret to be shared,\nHey, Mr. King, how I wish I was back there.\n\nNow, I've got 10 things lined up on a shelf,\nReasons to be cheerful for myself,\nI don't know why you're showing me the sky,\nYou say you see heaven,\nI see hell, but want to try.\n\nAnd the world is a place, and I pray it's on my side,\nBut I'd find greater comfort if I just lay down and died,\nI don't know what's become of the girl who once knew sunshine,\nWhat's become of the girl who knew sorrow but was strong?\nHey, Mr. King you were right, all along,\nMr. King you were right,\nOh, Mr. King, you were right-I was wrong.\n\n", "album": {"title":

me,\n'Cause I don't know myself from one day to the next,\nAnd I don't pose perplexities purposely,\nThis isn't a game, this isn't a test.\n\nSo hey, you, could you give it a rest?\nJust take me home and get me undressed,\nPut on a fire and make it enough,\nFor we're geeks, but we know this is love.\n\nNine am to the beat of a drum,\nAs we drive through the canyon,\nI'm feeling the hum of the engine,\nMy head and my heart are a-swim : will your cat be ok?\nYour wife was she in?\nYour wife, is she in???\n'Cause I don't presume to know shit about you,\nWhen you won't really tell me until I beg you to,\nBut I know that perplexity's a wonderful thing,\nIt's a sudden found joy, the strangeness it brings...\n\nSo hey, you, could you give it a rest?\nJust take me home and get me undressed,\nPut on a fire and make it enough,\nOh, we're geeks, but we know this is love.\n\nI like that we argue,\nBut not everyday,\nYour scent in a room,\nAnd the way that you say 'color' not 'colour'.\n\nWhat colour today?\nIt's grey, grey, it's grey.\n\nSo hey, you, could you give it a rest?\nJust take me home and get me undressed,\nPut on a fire and make it enough,\nOh, we're geeks, but
