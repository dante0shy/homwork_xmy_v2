they might be giants\nAnd they take to the air with stone temple pilots\nOh man my parachute club with the motley Crue,\nMy B-52 fires nine inch nails radiohead,\nI cause phonetic quiet riots.\nAnd tragically hip fight with the spirit of the west,\nSociety's no fucking use\nDo white zombies have no effects?\nNow cowboys are turning into junkies\nHanging themselves with lassos\nSinging blues about rodeos that once stood true.\nHave no time to fight with those fools.\nAlice's in chains and cold hearted iron maidens\nClaim that the ministries have the cure for U2.\nWhile everyone's raging against the machine\nThey're watching us on satellites from Georgia.\nBut there's more to my set than Alanis\nAnd it won't crash into Vegas\nCause my man smith has got the arrow.\nThe moral to this story is hades hath no fury,\nAnd MC scorn,\nAnd I would continue this verse\nBut nothing rhymes with orange.\n\n", "album": {"title": "Monsters_In_The_Closet_(2002)&&7852", "genre": "Alternative Hip

form\nGentle and precious\nWe connect on more than just mental\nDon't let this shit stress us\nI'm okay if you're okay\nI know it sounds clich'\nBut we built this whole relationship from sand and clay\nNow we're so strong\nWe've got a concrete bond\nAnd it completes so solid\nI had to write this song\n\nAnd it's a long way down\nIt's a long way down\nIt's such a long way down\nTo the place

does happen\nTry to remember how hard you worked to get there\nAnd appreciate that's shit\nKeep climbing\nBattleaxe\n\nI'm shark where you swim\nSharp as a dart in your skin\nWe've been given a title that's not hard to defend\nNot just my partners my friends\nSee this from start till the end\nWith words that alter the wind\n'Cause we assault with a pen\nAnd hit with the song\nNo problems here we getting along\nTake turns from learnin from our mistakes\nAdmit when we wrong\nAnd everybody knows how to fight\nTo shows that are tight\nAppropriate strikes\nNobody's sober tonight\n\nTake a walk on the wild side\nGive me beats and I'll never die\nIll hold your mind like a hypnotist\nSwing the watch into overdrive\nThere's no rabbit or wand\nMy habits are rippin a song\nThe magic comes from the act of people waving their arms\nI'm as sane as I was\nGiven and receiving the love\nLivin' and breathing this stuff\n{With Rob the Viking on drums}\nBattleaxe warriors ' mad child prevail\nThis is
