that place\nEven your emotions had an echo\nIn so much space\n\nAnd when you're out there, without care\nYeah, I was out of touch\nBut it wasn't because I didn't know enough\nI just knew too much, mmm\n\nDoes that make me crazy?\nDoes that make me crazy?\nDoes that make me crazy?\nPossibly\n\nAnd I hope that you are having the time of your life\nBut think twice\nThat's my only advice, mmm\n\nCome on now, who do you\nWho do you, who do you, who do you think you are?\nHa ha ha, bless your soul\nYou really think you're in control?\n\nWell, I think you're crazy\nI think you're crazy\nI think you're crazy\nJust like me\n\nMy heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb\nAnd all I remember\nIs thinking, I want to be like them\n\nMmm, ever since I was little\nEver since I was little, it looked like fun\nAnd it's no coincidence I've come\nAnd I can die when I'm done\n\nBut maybe I'm crazy\nMaybe you're crazy\nMaybe we're crazy\nProbably\n\n", "album": {"title":

smilin'\nOut in the sun, havin' fun and feelin' free (oh I'm feelin' free)\nAnd I can tell you know how hard this life can be\nBut you keep on smilin' for me\n\n(Little girl gonna smile at you)\n(Little girl gonna smile at you)\n\nWhat went right?\nWhat went wrong?\nWas it the story or was it the song?\nWas it overnight or did it take you long?\nWas knowing your weakness what made you strong?\n\nOr all the above, oh how I love to see you smiling\nAnd oh yeah, take a little pain just in case\nYou need something warm to embrace\nTo help you put on a smiling face\n\n(Little girl gonna smile at you)\n(Little girl gonna smile at you)\n\nPut on a smiling face\n\nDon't you go off into the new day with any doubt\nHere's a summary of something that you could smile about\nSay for instance my girlfriend, she bugs me all the time\nBut the irony of it all is that she loves me all the time\n\n(Oh see)\n(Doo doo doo, doo doo doo)\n(Doo doo doo, doo doo doo)\n\nI want to be you whenever I see you smiling\nBecause its easily one of the hardest things to do (hardest things to do)\nYour worries and fears become your friends\nAnd they end up smiling at you\n\nPut on a smiling face\n\n",
