feeling prone\nMy heart has turned to stone\nCan't wait for you\nOceans that I've crossed\nThe wars I've fought and lost\nI'll wait for you\nTime to pay but I'm afraid of the cost\nOh please, please!\n\nIt's all wasted - Waiting by the phone\nIt's all wasted - Feeling so alone\nIt's all wasted - Hours past like dreams\nIt's all wasted - Quiet save my dreams\nIt's all wasted - Waiting by the phone\nIt's all wasted - Feeling cold as stone\nIt's all wasted - Now I have to choose\nIt's all wasted - Feeling there's so much to lose\n\nToo many times I wonder just what is wrong\nHave I created problems?\nHave I been strong?\nWho can I blame for all the misery I see forming?\nHave I been staring at the bottom for too long?\n\nToday there's no one home\nI sit here all alone\nI wait for you\nSad and feeling prone\nMy heart has turned to stone\nCan't wait for you\nOceans that I've crossed\nThe wars I've fought and lost\nI'll wait for you\nTime to pay but I'm afraid of the cost\nOh please, please!\n\nIt's all wasted - Waiting by the phone\nIt's all wasted - Feeling so alone\nIt's all wasted - Hours past like dreams\nIt's all wasted - Quiet save my dreams\nIt's all wasted - Waiting by the phone\nIt's all wasted - Feeling cold as stone\nIt's all wasted - Now I have to choose\nIt's all wasted - Feeling there's so much to lose\nI'm locked out\nI'm blocked with no one to hear me plead\nAnd I've watched out\nBut I still found no one to call to softly\n\nIt's all wasted - Waiting by the phone\nIt's all wasted - Feeling so alone\nIt's all wasted - Hours past like dreams\nIt's all wasted - Quiet save my dreams\nIt's all wasted - Feeling sad and prone\nIt's all wasted - Feeling cold as stone\nIt's all wasted - Now I have to choose\nIt's all wasted - Feeling
