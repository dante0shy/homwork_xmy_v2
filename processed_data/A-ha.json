you can see it clearly\nWhere we overstepped the line\n\nWhat you going to do when lights go out\nWhat you going to think it's all about\nWhat you going to do when time is up\nWhat you going to do to make it change the way you feel\n\nOur life's a precious gift\nYou've felt it once or twice\nBut everything comes once\nBut once a million times\n\nBut you can find it anywhere\nYou know I speak the truth\nI wish there was a way back\nTo the summers of our youth\n\nWhat you going to do when time is up\nWhat you going to do to make a start\nWhat you going to do when lights go out\nWhat you going to think it's all a-, think it's all about\n\n", "album": {"title": "Analogue_(2005)&&6964", "genre": "New Wave", "year": 2005}}, {"title": "Analogue (All I Want)", "href":

sink in\nWith everything this way it's better to forget\nThan end up in a place with something to regret\n\nYour transatlantic shopping spree, your health forever guarantees\nOrganic bio life's a breeze in cosy prisons\nBut hiding out in a salad bar isn't going to get you far\nAnd bottled wine is vinegar tomorrow\n\nAnd everything around it makes your pretty head spin\nIt's piling up high and you're back where you begin\nMoments you tried so hard to forget\nAre promising to have been the best one's yet\nYeah, every time you shut your eyes it appears\nEvery time you trace your steps back here\nNone of your convictions have the same old ring\nBut no doubt you found a place for everything cosy prisons\n\nSo if you're careful you won't get hurt\nBut if you're careful all the time then
