You ask me, my dear\nWill there be fairies or things to fear?\nFor fairies sake I'd say you better come with me\nSo soon you'll see\nNow up and down it goes and round\nRound and round and round\n\nPraise to my cleverness\nThey all follow me\nAll praise to innocence\nThat's everything it needs\nFly in\nFly out\nThey'll leave it all behind\n\nNo one ever dares to speak\nIt's nothing else but fantasy\nIt's make believe\nMake believe\nNo one ever dares to speak\nIt's nothing else but fantasy\nBut one day it all will come to life\n\nStep out of line\nAnd I'll teach you how to fly\nThen away we'll go\nLeave your mark land of mine\nLeave your mark in the land of mine\n\nLife is a map and it is quite confusing\nThe lights are up now let the play begin\nShe flies, she flies\nInto the light she flies\nNo words like \"Just\" in mind\nShe's finding Neverland\nThere on the day she dies\nDon't stop it now\nShe still enjoys the scene\nDon't stop it now\nDon't stop it now\nDon't stop it now\nDon't stop it now, now, now\n\nNo one ever dares to speak\nIt's nothing else but fantasy\nIt's make believe\nMake believe\nNo one ever dares to speak\nIt's nothing else but fantasy\nBut one day it all will come to life\n\nStep out of line\nAnd I'll teach you how to fly\nThen away we'll go\nLeave your mark land of mine\nLeave your mark in the land of mine\n\n", "album": {"title": "Fly_(2006)&&2726", "genre": "", "year": 2006}}]
