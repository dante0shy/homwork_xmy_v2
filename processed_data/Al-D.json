Jones\nWhen Fat Pat died, we was all alone\nThat boy was the coldest, on the microphone\nScrew took it harder, than anyone thought\nIt's hard to be apart, from someone close to your heart\nSouth Park from the start, all of a sudden\nThe whole nation, all 'bout the Screw Shop on Cullen\nNovember 16th, I sat and cried\nCause that was the day, that Houston Texas died\n\nI'll never forget true love see, it's gon last forever\nKeep my feet on solid ground, so we could ball together\nSince a young one never done one, stay true to the heart\nYou kept my head above water, gave me spark from the start\nYou put the mic in my hand, plus put your trust in me\nDodging cases being a G, you got me out of the streets\nGave me the capital of Texas, so I could throw away the pyreeces\nPut a queen on my shoulder, when nights were cold as misses\nHustling smiles appear the tears, the tears from younger years\nUntil they find us riders, make sure you standing here\nS.U.C. for L-I-F-E, Screw blew one with the streets\nSlowed down originator, keeping the trunk on beat\nMy faith in G-O-D, putting the world up under my feet\nMaking imitators duketators, bow down and can't compete\nFrom a G to a G, this here's for you to me\nStaying down putting it down, screaming Screw for eternity\n\n\nWhoever knew he would create a new sound, never been heard\nTransform a simple name, into a household word\nHe gained fame but never changed, never switched gears\nWhen you met him it was like, you been knowing him twenty years\nWas never fake, blessed to make the rap scene elevate\nGenius, watch that boy slow it down and still accelerate\nGod gave him a gift, and my partna knew how to use it\nBut the love I got for Screw, ain't got nothing to do with music\n'Cause when he left, the physical was consumed\nBut his spirit manifesting, everybody in this room\nA real partna forever, I know I can never be him\nBut if I make him my example, when you see me then you'll see him\nS for slowing it down, C cold creating\nR stands for realer than real, and never hating\nE forever lasting, effect never corrupt\nW for the world, cause that's what he screwed up\n\nMan I'll never forget, the difference time can make\nMan I'll never forget, coming down in the 8\nMan I'll never forget, we drunk the pint straight\nWe been freestyling, since them old grey tapes\nAnd then came the day, that we was making them G's\nHad them niggaz lined up, like we was slanging them ki's\nBut we ain't slanging D, we just moving C.D.'s\nPeople coming to the shop, way from over the seas\nBut still we some G's, or should I say that we back\nComing down in a Impala, with the candy wet\nComing down MLK, with the music that bump\nWe was swanging and banging, steady popping the trunk\nSay what's up to that Gator, Mafio and that Pat\nI know y'all looking down from heaven, watching over our back\nWhen they mention Screwed Up Click, they gon say that we done it\nMayn them boys done blew up, like the flight 800\n\n\n(Willean)\nDJ Screw playa, I'll never forget\nRepresent S.U.C., forever my set\nI'll never regret, the times we got blowed\nOn the road doing shows, all across the globe\nIt's your boy Willean, and I'm holding it down\nLegendary status Screw, steady slowing it down\nFor H-Town fa sho, we done lost a soldier\nWe gon finish what you live, and I'ma put that on the Clover\nIt ain't over, pour and sipping the plain soda\nSwitching lanes over, in my black Range Rover\nThe Chemist that's right, I done shed some tears\nAll the car shows we wrecked, and bled for years\nYou one of my peers, DJ Screw you kept it real\nYou one of a kind, so you one out a mill\nI'ma stay representing, Southsive for live\nAnd if S.U.C. get a deal, it's gon be a hundred mill\n\n(Al-D)\nIf nobody else, could feel my pain\nIt was you in my corner, through the heat and the rain\nCan't call one time, you didn't make me smile\nTook a fall in the Penn, boy you fed my child\nKept my name on fire, like I never left\nKept your eyes on my family, and never slept\nSnatched my ass out the streets, and put a mic in my hand\nPut my strap on the shelf tray, my fiends for fans\nI was hard head misled, seeking for bread\nWithout the music in my life, I know I would have been dead\nBut the Lord sent you to me, like a guardian angel\nWhen my feet was caught up in a tangle\nSo please smile for me, cause Screw you got me thoed in this game\nI salute you with my fist, your name was never in vein\nSee the plack on the wall, all our dreams came true\nAnd I'm still giving thanks to you\n\n", "album": {"title":

waking the hood up\nCrawling purple passion, up in my cup\nI-10 to 71, mash the gas to Austin\nChrome glossing, big bossing flossing\nBlock to block spot to spot, no need for tripping\nStill collecting my ends, in the 2K dimension\nTwist a leaf out the leaf, as I crawl through the street\nWaiting on the sunrise, praying a G on deep\nIt's a Sunday a fun day, and I crawl down Sunnydale\nSparkling sun rays, making the game prevail\nJazzy broads whispering, boppers shaking they tail\nYou can do what you do, I'm all about my mail\n\n(Hook: Ronnie Spencer - 2x)\n\n(Yungstar)\nLights, camera, action it's on\nBang out my garage, and I'm on 20 inch chrome\nGrab my phone, 'cause I'm calling Al-D\nWhen they see the buttons, don't try to compare me\nShe gon stare G, so you better get her\nI'm coming down, and I'm banging the Hardest Pit of the litter\nDown South, keep our name out your mouth\nAnd we'll get it on, and we known to buy a house\nAnd buy the block it don't stop, with shoes and socks\nBet the top drop, and let the bumper unlock\nBut me I'm rolling foreign, never ever alone\nSwanging left and right, with alarm cats knowing\nPaints I be pouring, and you know I'm so wet\nGetting me a ticket from the laws, you wanna bet\nThey can't stand me, pulling off they say you dripping too much candy\nYes I can't stand it, I'm the drank and drip bandit\nYou can't handle it, bought the ice that sunk the Titanic\nDon't panic, when you see me riding with Janet\nOn the escapade, riding a Escalade\nBreak these boys off with techs, my chest plate\n\n(Hook: Ronnie Spencer - 4x)\n\n(Ronnie Spencer)\nWe gonna swang, we gonna bang\nWe gonna grip on wood, baby - 4x\n\n", "album": {"title": "4_Da_Green_(2001)&&4866", "genre": "", "year":
