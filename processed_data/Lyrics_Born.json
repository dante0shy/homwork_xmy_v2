beautiful friendship\nAnd how relations get strained with pressure and tension\nWho's wrong, correct, so, so, subjective\nYou look back its hard 'cause the mind gets adventurous\nDates get mixed up facts disconnected\nThe only thing you remember is the feeling that you're left with\nIt started as a blessing\n\nNow you could write this off as luck or one of life's coincidences\nBut at some point you think god damn what are the chances\nPeople with similar interests and influences\nComing together at that moment to form a kinship\nIt's like you knew that you was brothers before your conception\nEven if you're not a spiritual person I admit shit\nAt that point I wasn't but at some point it sets in\nIt be foolish to dismiss this as coincidence\nNow this shit is different, somewhere this is written\nBe part of a mission, this shit is predestined\nCloser than close like flesh is to tendon\nShare my 50 cent bag of chips with my freshman\nHalf a half a gas station sandwich no question\nTalking shit to me well then talking shit to him then\nFamily is sacred it must be protected\nFamily is sacred and it must be protected\n\nOver time I don't know what happens something got infected\nPeople grow in different ways at different rates I guess\nIt ridiculous, little shit it suddenly gets big shit\nLapses in communication, glitches in the system\nHe said that she said what nobody said shit\nBut you'll never know 'cause everyone's passive aggressive\nI sit down smoke pow wow how everyone said shit\nPeople cease to make the effort to get to the essence\nPeep this shit out though this shit is really twisted\nFunny thing is that you and I do it every minute\nWe take it in rhetoric every time somebody says shit\nAgainst us stock piling every little incident\nWhat's stupid is all the bullshit that's circulating\nCould be fixed in an instant with simple conversation\nBut you know how pride is\nA bitch with her fist clenched\nThat mixed with the fat drama gets addictive\nWounds need dressing and they don't receive attention\nIt snowballs and festers and creates resentment\nPeople demonise each other brave discontent\nBut nobody could've been prepared for the next step\nThe nature of the predator is calculated pensive\nWaiting in the brush patiently revving they engines\nDespite the colour that they got all they see is crimson\nWaiting for they prey to become desperate defenceless\nOutside is always over just beyond the fences\nToday the gate is open though today they make an entrance\nFriendly at first laughs jokes like we best friends\nSlowly though you start to see they become hidden agendas\nNine to five one day insecure self perceptions\nShines a spotlight on all those paranoid self perceptions\nThings begin to heat up everyone's already stretched thin\nHow could you be well how could you be so deceptive\nAny second now someone will snap like a bread stick\nAnd what once was simply dissolves like a breath mint\nJust like that you start to ask yourself questions\nIs this really worth all the emotion and depressment\nDo the benefits and perks outweigh the pressure\nLet me step back give this relationship assessment\n\n",
