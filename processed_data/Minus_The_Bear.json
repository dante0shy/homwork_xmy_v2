night\nUnder pin-prick light.\n\nThe wind on the boat's deck\nIs a cold hand on the neck\nOr slipping into a cold bed.\n\nIt's been so long\nThat it seems like I've never\nDanced with anyone.\n\nShe moves so well.\n\nIf we go outside\nWe can take in a haze of\nRoche Harbor light\nAnd drink a bottle of red wine,\nForgetting to tell time.\n\nJust sit still,\nWe've moved enough.\n\n", "album":

the store\nSo I don't have to listen to anyone say anything.\nAnd I swim out as far as I can\nAnd float on my back\nJust waiting for nothing.\nI hope they never come back to this house.\nIt's a lot more fun alone.\nI can do anything I want\nAnd so I'm swimming\nMore like floating\nAnd I'll just stay out here\nUntil the night comes crashing down\nAnd I swim out as far as I can\nAnd float on my back\nJust waiting for nothing.\nThey always come home\nAt the wrong time\nLike when I'm all right\nAnd don't need no one at all.\n\n", "album": {"title":

this home to you\n\nThis is a city for not sleeping\nAnd the clocks are set by feel.\nAt this moment from where I sit,\nNone of it seems real.\n\nDon't cry, I'll bring this home to you\nIf I can make
