the Nation of Islam\nHe changed his name to Allah, and took his less astere vision\nOf Islam, directly to young people in Harlem\nHe called his new movement: The Five Percent Nation\"\n\n(Lord Jamar)\nGreatest story never told, Clarence Smith\nClarence 13X, to the Father Allah, let's go\nAiyo, February 22nd, 1928\nDanville, Virginia, it was still the winter\nClarence Smith, he was born a Friday\nThe fifth son, of Louis and Mary\nAfter him, came Dennis and Harry\nNow that's seven, six boys, one girl\nWho ever thought he would change the world\nHis mother nicknamed him Put, and simply put\nThis was the time during Jim Crow\nWhere laws dictated where a nigga could go\nBut the fam didn't care, I don't wanna be rude whitey\nI don't wanna go where I know they don't like me\nIn '46, Allah came to Harlem\nTo join his mother, and his older brothers\nOnce in New York, Put became pudding\nYeah, the God was smooth\nHe performed odd jobs, he was an honest dude\nAmongst them, fruit stand that he ran\nIn a little hole in the wall, this was Harlem, y'all\nDeveloped a love for gambling\nPlayed a lotta pool, took fools for they jewels\nThen he met Eline, wanted to marry, but she was only seventeen\nNeeded her mother's permission, they still had 2 sons, even though she was bitching\nAllah said \"I got something for you\"\nYou don't have don't have the only daughter, then he married Dora\nHe had two seeds with her\nClarence and Christine, they were hers\nAnd that's just the way it was, back in the day\nWhen Allah came up, just the greatest story never told\nGreatest story never told\n\n(Chorus 2X: sample)\n\"Hey, hey, now what I say\"\n\n(Lord Jamar)\nIn 1950, Clarence joined the army\nAnd went to fight in the Korean war\nSeeing war, it had to effect him\nSupporting two families, you had to respect him\nWhile he away, Dora became Muslim\nN.O.I., Honorable Elijah Muhammed\nWhen Clarence returned, he too accepted\nBy the teacher of Islam, he was truly effected\nTemple Number 7, Mr. Malcolm X\nThis was the time that Allah met Justice\nClarence became Student Minister over time\nHe said some things that put him over the line\nHe said the Black Man's God, not just Farrad\nPlease, let's go yell it in the yard\nBut the Nation said no, you gots to go\nHe took Justice, and some brothers and he left the temple\nBack to the streets of Harlem\nThis time to teach black youth not reached by Muslims\nBirth of a Nation, with far reach and implications\n1963 is the shit to me, 'cause that's the year that the God made history\nLooked himself and said it ain't no mystery\nThis the greatest story never told\n\n(Lord Jamar)\nAllah made, Supreme Mathematics, Supreme Alphabets\nA profound way to break it down\nHe took it to the poor and the hardcore\nYoung thugs and niggaz on drugs\nFirst born student by the name of Kareem\nHad the power to attract black knowledge seeed\nKareem became Black Messiah\nAnd then he run the first borns by it\nIt was Kareem, Naheem, Uhu, Kaheem\nAl Jabar, or Prince Allah, Al Jamel, Bilal or Jihad, Akbar, and Al Salam\nThey called Allah the father, they were from broken home\nAnd this man was the only father they had known\nAllah's Nation of the Five Percenters\nWill soon influence the epicenter\nAllah got shot, and soon after arrested\nBefore the judge, Allah contested\nYou got it wrong, I'm Allah, I tell you\nThe judge said you crazy, and shipped him to Bellevue\nThis is the greatest story never told\nThe greatest story never told\n\n(Lord Jamar)\nAllah got, sent to Matter One, first borns carried on\nWe could live to wait it, and got situated\nIn '67, Allah came home, we had our first problem and see how we had grown\nThey were thousands of Five Percenters, Allah had to borrow some muslims\nThey said \"I surrender\", 21-22, Seventh Avenue\nIt was a gift from the mayor, and we still right there\nSham God designed the flag, we put it on the window of the street acad'\nIn '68, Dr. King was assassinated, many cities got decimated\nThat night in Harlem, the Gods were out\nHelping to keep the peace, 85's wanna wild out\nThe same year, Allah prepared, his Five Percent for the day he wouldn't be here\nIf I die, I don't want you cry, if I could, I'll reach up and slap you in the eye\nBesides, if you keep on teaching, I'll live forever\nBut physically, no man lives forever\nJune 12th, 1969, indelible in the God's minds\nAllah Just took us through the science, of male and female\nBut we didn't notice the details\n'Cause when he left, he got in the cab\nBut it wasn't in Allah's cab, didn't observe that\nShortly after, the word came back\nThat Allah got gunned down, Five Percenters rushed down\nTo Amlocate Towers, hundred 12th street\nIn the elevators where the God fell, G\nMany Gods were crying, at least one remembered\nWhat Allah said, didn't let a tear shed\nWe said fareful at community chapel\nAs to who killed Allah to this day, we're baffeled\nThese funeral possess the firm, clear for his cremation\nThis is the Nation of his creation\nThis is the greatest story never told\nGreatest story never told\n\n(Sample)\n\"Allah was assassinated in 1969, that case was never solved\nHis movement survived him, today it's known as the Nation of Gods and Earths\nOr the Five Percenters, tens of thousands of young black men and women\nFollow his teachings,

negative\nBorn is bring into existence\nThat can only happen if there's persistence\nI was Born twice, first through my moms\nThen through the womb of Islam\nBorn is be complete, cause after that\nAll numbers repeat, just add the zero\nCipher is a circle, three hundred sixty degrees\nKnowledge 120, Wisdom 120, Understanding 120\nA Cipher is a person, place or thing\nMy blood line trace back to kings\nA Cipher is a person, place or thing\nMy blood line trace back to kings\nNow do the Math...\n\n", "album": {"title": "The_5%25_Album_(2006)&&6026", "genre": "", "year": 2006}}, {"title":
