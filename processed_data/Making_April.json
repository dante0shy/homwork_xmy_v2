wonder how\nI could be without you anywhere at all\nAnd I'd run to find you anywhere at all\nBut don't you run too far away\nI'm racing time for you\nYou know I need this now\n'Cause I've been burning all my aspirations down\nBut I've been feeling closer day by day\nYou know I'll chase you down\nIt feels like summer is on it's way\nWill it ever get here\nThese sheltered hearts can't make me stay\nNo I won't forget we're everything I know\nAnd I hope you take this everything I know\nAnd you make it worth this ride to me\n\nChorus (extended)\n\n", "album": {"title":

smiles\nAnd I left your room for the very last time and I know\nThat I can't sleep\nWith all of these things they're running through my head\nSo I stayed up and I\n\nI wrote this song about you\nIsn't that cliche of me to do?\nBut it's nothing for you\nThe band just needed something more to play\nSo don't blush or hooray at the possible sound of your name\n'Cause no, I wouldn't go that far\nNo\n\nNow I\nI've watched these years disperse and still this verse lacks words\nAnd I'm losing all but a memory or two\n'Cause now I see you and I can't hold back a smile\nYour fashion's long gone out of style\nAnd there's nothing left to impress me anymore\n'Cause I know\nThat I can't see\nThat same girl that I had known so long ago\nSo I gave up and I\n\nI wrote this song about you\nIsn't that cliche of me to do?\nBut it's nothing for you\nThe band just needed something more to play\nSo don't blush or hooray at the possible sound of your name\n'Cause no, I wouldn't go that far\nNo, I wouldn't go that far\n\nAnd you're dying to know\nIf a thank you will show up on my back sleeve\nBut I don't think I'll tell\nOf who crafted this hell and fixed it on me to the world\n\nI wrote this song\nI wrote it about you\nI wrote this song all about you\nYeah, the band just needed one more song to play\nYeah, the band just needed one more song to play\nYeah\n\nI wrote this song

dry\nAnd we both laid entwined, stared at the night\nClouds overhead, but that was all right\n'Cause then and there with the wind in your hair\nHeaven was jealous to merely look fair against you\nAnd all I need now is for this moon to keep light in its desolate skyline for good\n\n'Cause these are the nights that you know when you're there\nYou couldn't have planned it much better I swear and you hope\nThat your senses aren't failing you now\nAnd you think to yourself now I could be wrong\nBut I might have just stolen this scene from a song and you know\nThat your senses aren't failing you now, but they're slipping away\n\nSo divine is this happening\nCan't I just graze your skin\nFor the rest of our time\nBut time isn't letting this night go on\nTill then and there, the wind in your hair\nNothing in this world could keep me from staring at you\nAnd all I need now is for that sun to stay under its glowing horizon for good, whoaoaoa\n\n'Cause these are the nights that you know when you're there\nYou couldn't have planned it much better I swear and you hope\nThat your senses aren't failing you now\nAnd you think to yourself now I could be wrong\nBut I might have just stolen this scene from a song and you know\nThat your senses aren't failing you now\n\nFailing you now\nYou could get lost in a night like this\nSo empty your thoughts and open your heart to the bliss\nThese are

hard to erase the feelings I've drawn\n\nI was caught in an awkward silence\nBroken down by the sound of your prelude\nThat you played to open our symphony\n\nI've been sleeping with the sunrise watching hours pass away\nIncidentally I'm just waiting for the dusk to kill the day\nBut now I'm waiting for your call\nWhile I bang on this piano like you care at all\n\nSo I'll waste these nights

their heads a little\nFurther to the ground\nThere's a season change\nAnd all the pinks and whites have turned to brown\nWill we make it through the fall?\nYeah, are we gonna make it through this fall?\n'Cause I don't wanna fall with you\n\nSo I'll waste these nights for a while\n(I'm trying) But I'll be holding onto you (We're dying) forever\n(Yeah) And this is where my heart is cold and
