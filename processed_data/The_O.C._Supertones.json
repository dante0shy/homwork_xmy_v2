God's gonna give or take it away.\n\nThis life,\nThis life is fleeting everything,\nEverything's dyin',\nBut one day I'll awake,\nAll my problems and my sin,\nThe won't matter to me then,\n\"Son, welcome home.\"\n\nThe day doesn't guarantee to come again,\nAnd life only promises that it will end,\nAnd we all gotta stand before the Lord one day,\nAnd I don't wanna die but I don't wanna stay down here\nI feel like a stranger,\nI know, I don't belong here,\nI wanna run and I'll fall down at Jesus' feet and lay.\nI can't way to here him say,\n\"Son, welcome home.\"\n\nBut I'm still here,\nAnd I'm tired,\nTired of sin and struggling,\nTired of almost everything\nAnd sometimes,\nSmall and clear\nI could swear that I could hear\nAngels voices in my ear\nSayin' \"welcome home.\"\n\n", "album": {"title": "Unite_(2005)&&5205", "genre": "Christian Ska", "year": 2005}}, {"title": "Little Man", "href": "Little_Man&&9152", "artist": {"unique_name": "The_O.C._Supertones"},

hundred dollar bill\nIt's all about cash flow the California dream\nTo make the grade you gotta make the green\nMy friend I'm the champion I've no time for losers\nNever ask for nothin' 'cause beggars can't be choosers\n\nLookin' our for number ones's a full time occupation\nI'll give to me myself and I my own salvation\nSome people try to tell me God can save me from my sin\nBut God can take a number and I'll pencil Him in\nBusy oh so busy I got no time to search\nMy Sunday's are all booked I've got no time for church\nThat's for those poor souls, dry as a stone\nGod bless this child 'cause this child's got His own.\n\nOh, let my pride fall down I'm a little man\n\nHe who gets the most toys and dies is the winner\nI'm livin' the high life with lobster tail dinners\nMy Lexus, my yacht, my gold chains and rings\nThese are a few of my favorite things\nBut most of all I keep my billfold the closest to my heart\nHouse decorated with million dollar works of art\nRoll with the Bigwigs they think I'm the man\nBut then I stop and look and think about how big I really am\n\nMammon is an unforgiving God, I cast him away\nI live my life to God, not to get paid\nMoney can't save your soul, don't think I can\nI look to God and I feel like a little man.\n\n", "album": {"title": "Unite_(2005)&&5205", "genre": "Christian Ska", "year": 2005}}, {"title": "Wilderness", "href":

refuge\nThat my thoughts and ways are not His\nI spend my life on looking up the answers\nIt's rare that I can't find a reason why\nBut reasons fail at children without mothers\nHis plan is more than I can know\n\nHave you ever held in doubt\nWhat this life is all about\nHave you questioned all these things that seem important to us\nDo you really wanna know\nOr are you a little scared\nYou're afraid that God is not really exactly what you'd have Him be\nWhat should I hold to and what should I do\nHow do I know if anything's true\nI'm somewhere in-between Canaan and Egypt\nA place called the wilderness\n\nI'm not one who always trusts their feelings\nI don't believe in what you'd call blind faith\nBut faith that you can do all that you promised\nAnd you said it all works for good\nIt's safe to say I don't see the big picture\nI can't see the forest for the trees\nAnd if five hundred lives\nWere mine to get to know\nYou all could be spent on just this\n\nGod do you really understand what it's like to be a man\nHave You ever felt the weight of loving all the things you Hate\nHave You struggled have you worried\nHow can You sympathize\n\nI have spoken too soon put my hand over my mouth\nI can't contend with You\nYour ways are so much higher\nAnd we pass through the fire that Christ endured before us\nWhen You were in the wilderness\n\n", "album": {"title":

haven't had the best of days\nBut I want to stop and thank you anyway\n\nAt the courthouse I waited\nAnd waited then I waited\nAt lunchtime my car stalled out\nI couldn't get it started\nHad a book by c.s. lewis\nI finished the last page and\nSlept on my desk for three hours\nJust like my high school days\n\n'Cause every single moment whether sleeping or awake\nIs your creation\nAnd what you've made is good\nI don't always thank you for the rough days and\nThe hard times in my life\nEven though I should\n\nGot home and decided I'd be in a bad mood\nMy shy and quiet wife said she didn't like
