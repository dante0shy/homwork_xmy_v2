Is there no one here at all?\nIs there any net left that could break our fall?\nIt'll be a day like this one when the sky falls down\nAnd the hungry and poor and deserted are found.\n\nAre you discontented? Have you been pushing hard?\nHave you been throwing down this broken house of cards?\nIt'll be a day like this one when the world caves in\nWhen the world caves in\nWhen the world caves in\n\nIs there nothing left now, nothing left to sing?\nAre there any left who haven't kissed the enemy?\nIs this the New Year or just another desperation?\n\nDoes justice ever find you? Do the wicked never lose?\nIs there any honest song to sing besides these blues?\nAnd nothing is OK until the world caves in\nUntil the world caves in\n'Til the world caves in\n\n", "album": {"title": "Nothing_Is_Sound_(2005)&&1532", "genre": "Alternative Rock", "year": 2005}}]
