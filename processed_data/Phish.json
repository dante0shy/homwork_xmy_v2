cause\nIt's quite a bit like trying to heal\nA gunshot wound with gauze\n\nIf you instead attempt to wrest\nThe pistol from the hand\nThen I would not be able to\nEquate my life with sand\n\nFlowing through the hourglass\nPushing through the funnel\nTurn once more while racing\nAll your siblings for the tunnel\n\nSlide and let the silicone\nEmbrace you as you fall\nThen bounce and land you let \nYour brothers crush you to the wall\n\nI would choose my own religion\nAnd worship my own spirit\nBut if he ever preached to me\nI wouldn't want to hear it\n\nI'd drop him, a forgotten god,\nLanguishing in shame\nAnd then if I hit stormy seas\nI'd have myself to blame\n\n", "album": {"title": "Farmhouse_(2000)&&7093", "genre": "Rock", "year": 2000}}, {"title": "Piper", "href":

all\nYou know I'll never look back again\nI turn my face into the howlin' wind\nIt took me a long time to get back on the train\n\nSee my face in the town that's flashing by\nSee me standing at the station in the rain\nSee me running there beside the car\nI left it all behind, again I'll travel far\nIt took me a long time to get back on the train\n\nWhen I jumped off, I had a bucket full of thoughts\nWhen I first jumped off, I held that bucket in my hand\nIdeas that would take me all around the world\nI stood and watched the smoke behind the mountains curl\nIt took me a long time to get
