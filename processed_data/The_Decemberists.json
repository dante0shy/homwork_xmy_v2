belly of a whale\n\nIts ribs our ceiling beams, \nIts guts our carpeting,\nI guess we have some time to kill \n\nYou may not remember me, \nI was a child of three \nAnd you a lad of eighteen \n\nBut I remember you, \nAnd I will relate to you \nHow our histories interweave\n \nAt the time you were a rake and a roustabout\nSpending all your money on the whores and hounds\nOh, oh\n\nYou had a charming air \nAll cheap and debonair \nMy widowed mother found so sweet \n\nAnd so she took you in, \nHer sheets still warm with him, \nNow filled with filth and foul disease \n\nAs time wore on you proved a debt-ridden drunken mess \nLeaving my mother a poor consumptive wretch\nOh, oh\n\nAnd then you disappeared, \nYour gambling arrears\nThe only thing you left behind \n\nAnd then the magistrate \nReclaimed our small estate \nAnd my poor mother lost her mind \n\nThen one day in spring my dear, sweet mother died \nBut before she did I took her hand as she, dying, cried:\nOh, oh\n \n\"Find him, bind him, tie him to a pole and break his\nFingers to splinters; drag him to a hole until he\nWakes up naked clawing at the ceiling of his grave\"\n\nIt took me fifteen years \nTo swallow all my tears\nAmong the urchins in the street  \n\nUntil a priory \nTook pity and hired me \nTo keep their vestry nice and neat \n\nBut never once in the employ of these holy men \nDid I ever once turn my mind from the thought of revenge\nOh, oh\n\nOne night I overheard \nThe prior exchanging words \nWith a penitent whaler from the sea \n\nThe captain of his ship \nWho matched you toe to tip \nWas known for wanton cruelty \n\nThe following day I shipped to sea with a privateer\nAnd in the whistle of the wind I could almost hear:\nOh, oh\n\n\"Find him, bind him, tie him to a pole and break his\nFingers to splinters; drag him to a hole until he\nWakes up naked clawing at the ceiling of his grave\n\n\"There is one thing I must say to you\nAs you sail across the sea \nAlways your mother will watch over you\nAs you avenge this wicked deed\"\n\nAnd then that fateful night \nWe had you in our sight\nAfter twenty months at sea\n\nYour starboard flank abeam, \nI was getting my muskets clean \nWhen came this rumbling from beneath \n\nThe ocean shook, the sky went black, and the captain quailed\nAnd before us grew the angry jaws of a giant whale\nOh, oh <i>[screaming]</i>\nOh <i>[screaming]</i>\n\nDon't know how I survived \nThe crew all was chewed alive \nI must have slipped between its teeth\n\nBut, O! what Providence! \nWhat divine intelligence! \nThat you should survive as well as me\n\nIt gives my heart great joy to see your eyes fill with fear \nSo lean in close and I will whisper the last words you'll hear\nOh, oh\n\n", "album": {"title":
