Give me a listen you corpses of cheer\nAt least those of you who still got an ear\nI'll tell you a story that'll make a skeleton cry\nOf our own jubiliciously lovely corpse bride\n\nBone boys\nDie, die we all pass away\nBut don't wear a frown 'cause it's really okay\nAnd you might try and hide\nAnd you might try and pray\nBut we all end up the remains of the day\nYeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (that's right)\nYeah yeah yeah\n\nBonejangles\nWell our girl is a beauty known for miles around\nWhen a mysterious stranger came into town\nHe's plenty good-looking, but down on his cash\nAnd our poor little baby, she fell hard and fast\nWhen her daddy said no, she just couldn't cope\nSo our lovers came up with a plan to elope\n\nBone boys\nDie, die we all pass away\nBut don't wear a frown 'cause it's really okay\nAnd you might try and hide\nAnd you might try and pray\nBut we all end up the remains of the day\nYeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\nYeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\nYeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\nYeah yeah yeah\n\n(Oh, that's right.\nOkay.
