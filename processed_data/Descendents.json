Food tastes good!\nJuicy burgers, greasy fries,\nTurkey legs and raw fish eyes\nTeenage girls, with ketchup too!\nGet out of my way, or I'll eat you\nI like food, food tastes good!\nI like food, food tastes good!\n\nI'm going to turn dining back into eating\n\nI like food! Food tastes good!\nI like food! Food tastes good!\n\n", "album": {"title": "Fat_(1981)&&7309", "genre": "", "year": 1981}}]
