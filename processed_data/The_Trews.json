locked up and lost inside\nIt doesn't matter for today\nMakes you old before your day, it's always rainin'\nDon't stay in, no escapin' your destiny\n\nMy heart is not the type to sway\nIt's good for any other day\nSo if you say that you will stay, and you'll be mine\nOh, you'll make everything OK\nI pushed the whole world far away, it's always rainin'\nDon't stay in, no escapin' your destiny\n\nI'm right on time, I'm makin' sunshine\nI'm makin' sunshine\nI'm right on time, I'm makin' sunshine\nI'm makin' sunshine\n\nThere was a time I was afraid\nI had my strength to steer at bay\nBut now's the time to stand away\nAnd take what's mine\nThe lesson's done, my dues are paid\n\nI'm right on time, I'm makin' sunshine\nI'm makin' sunshine\nI'm right on time, I'm makin' sunshine\nI'm makin' sunshine\nI'm right on time, I'm makin' sunshine\nI'm makin' sunshine\nSunshine\nSunshine\nSunshine\nSunshine\nSunshine\n\n", "album": {"title": "Den_Of_Thieves_(2005)&&5565",

'nuff did this to me\nHer lies they won me over quick\nShe ruled my mind, my heart, my dick\nI took the line, the hook, the bait\nAnd now I'm sick from what I ate\n\nThere's no sight she'd rather see\nThan poor ol' broken hearted me\nHer mission is my misery\nPoor ol' broken hearted me\n\nThe force of her magnetic pull was cruel and unusual\nAnd when she calls, I wag my tail\nI'm harder than a coffee nail\nA pilgrim on my bended knees\nI'd cross the desert if it please you\nBaby treat me as you will\nYours to bless, yours to kill\n\nThere's no sight she'd rather see\nThan poor ol' broken hearted me\nSo Happy when I'm on my knees\nPoor ol' broken hearted me\n\nShe'll get bored of me one day\nOr I'll resolve to walk away\nWith good intent my road is paved\nBut I'm not sure I want to be saved\n\nThere's no sight she'd rather see\nThan poor ol' broken hearted me\nHer mission is my misery\nPoor ol' broken hearted me\n\nThere's no sight she'd rather see\nThan poor ol' broken hearted
