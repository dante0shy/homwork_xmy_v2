Smile. Smile.\n\n2nd Verse:\nFeels like I've been baptized\nAlmost drowned but I survived\nShe held me under for 5\nYears of my life\nBut today I'm living proof\nYour worst fear came true\nI'm doing all right without you baby yes I am\nI'm leaving all those grudges behind me\nThrowing fear out the window\nSo when these blessings come to find me\nThey will have room to breathe and grow\nLet my blessings overflow and get my life under control\nSo my kids will know, Daddy finally let go\nI finally let go\n\nChorus/Bridge:\nBlue skies- blue skies are calling you\nNo more teary eyes- no more crying for you baby\nAnd I don't despise you at all\nI thank you for the lessons you have taught me\n\n", "album": {"title": "Lyfe_268-192_(2004)&&651", "genre": "R&B", "year": 2004}}, {"title":
