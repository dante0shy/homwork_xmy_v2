sung\nAnd will ring in the ears of everyone\n\nSaving our children, saving our land\nProtecting us from things we can't understand\nPower and Glory, Justice and Right\nI'm sure that you'll help us to see the light\nAnd the love that you radiate will keep us warm\nAnd help us to weather the storm\n\nCruise, you have taken me in\nAnd just when I've got you under my skin\nYou start ignoring the fears I have felt\n'Cause you know you can always make my poor heart melt\n\nPlease don't take what I'm saying amiss\nOr misunderstand at a time such as this\nBecause if such close friends should ever fall out\nWhat would there be left worth fighting about\n\nPower and glory, justice and right\nI'm sure that you'll help them to see the light\nWill you save our children, will you save our land\nAnd protect us from all the things we can't understand?\nPower and glory and justice for all\nWho will we turn to when your hard rain falls?\n\n", "album": {"title": "About_Face_(1984)&&729", "genre":

memories\nAnd clutch them to our hearts\nWe're disembodied entities\nWe move in fits and starts\nFor burning wine\nIntoxicates,\nAnd takes all caution in its flames\nAll lovers are deranged.\n\nYou know that you don't really fall in love\nUnles you're seventeen\nThe break of day will make your spirits fly\nBut you can't know what it means\nUnless you're seventeen.\n\nIt takes a fight to start a fight\nAnd differences remain\nWe have the right to think we're right\nWe're addicts feigning shame\nFor love recalled\nIs love reborn\nWe're determined to relive the pain\nBut then lovers are

said?\n\nOn your own admission you raised up the knife\nAnd you brought it down ending another man's life\nWhen it was done you just threw down the blade\nWhile the red blood spread wider like the anger you made\n\nI don't want this anger that's burning in me\nIt's something from which it's so hard to be free\nBut none of the tears that we cry in sorrow or rage\nCan make any difference, or turn
