rest for the living... only death\n\nChaos and the cold endless void\nIs all that awaits...\nWe are all forgotten\nWe are all dust\nWe are all unimportant\nWe are all dead\nNo rest for the living... only death\n\nYou thought me mad\nYou wanted me to be like you,\nTo see the error of my ways...\nSo you told me things I knew were wrong\nYou showed me why I would never fit in\n\nWhy then, does what I have become surprise you?\n\nDreamer,\nProphet,\nSinger of strange songs\n\nI went my own twisted way\nMocked by the world\nFeared by the righteous\nBut always where I wanted...\n\nNow that all has changed,\nAnd the night is colder\n\nNow that life has shown its true colors\n\nAnd you...\nYou are forgotten\nYou are old\nYou are unimportant\nYou are dead\n\nCan you face the real truth?\nCan you call me a madman anymore?\n\nDo you regret your selfless life?\nThe things you could never do,\nIn fear of what others would think?\n\nDo you see why I became a:\nDreamer,\nProphet,\nSinger of strange songs.\n\n", "album": {"title": "Beyond_The_Apocalypse_(2004)&&368", "genre": "Black Metal", "year": 2004}}, {"title": "Celestial Deconstruction", "href": "Celestial_Deconstruction&&1131", "artist":

darkness unravel, a horrific sphere unfolds\n\nAn altering of the senses - to discover\nWhat is behing light, beyond celestial slavery\nEntangles the mind in dark waves, fiery &amp; monotonous\nDeep is the well of dark mystery\n\nThe enlightenment of madness presents itself\nOn the soil above a lower world\nIn everlasting ebony shades of the damned\nChoirs of madness chant in agony, as blood\nFlows furiously (through my veins)\n\nBlurred visions through a smoke-filled sky\nWith fists clenched, I gaze on through the ugly\nThe only right path\n\nThe surge of deconstruction casts light aside\nThe summoning at last\nDeceiver, pioneer of this insight\nConsume what is of joy\n\nConsume what is of joy!\n\nAnd enless rage until we dance on the\nHypocrites' grave\nStep on the crucifix\nAns speak the tongue of blasphemy\n\nThe shivery\nCrawling, freezing through the innards &amp; up the spine\nThe separating of this shell of flesh\n&amp; A dark spirituality\nDo I believe?\nIt believes in me\n\n", "album": {"title": "Hellfire_(2005)&&7126", "genre": "Black Metal", "year": 2005}}]
