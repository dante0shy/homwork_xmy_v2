this thing goodbye\n\nNow I'm watching the fumes foul up the sunrise, I'm watching the light fade away \nAnd I'm hoping tonight that I'll open the door, and you'll stand here and say \n\nCome on babe, let's kiss this thing goodbye \nBetter make it sooner than later \nBefore it all turns sour \nDon't you know we'd better kiss this thing goodbye\n\n", "album": {"title": "Waking_Hours_(1989)&&5224",
