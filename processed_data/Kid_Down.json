mind?\nInsecurity made a scar\nFelt a need to be apart\n\nYou've tried out, tried on many things\nIt doesn't mean you've failed all these years\nBut we're dying inside because of you\nTrust me, trust everything I do.\n\nWe've fought to stand where we stand\nIf ruined we'll know who to blame\nWe cannot let this fall down\nIt's all just a perfect game\n\nYou left a part of yourself\nA few miles down the road\nShattered pieces of happiness\nThat got away a long long time ago\n\nThe headlights\nWill guide you\nThrough misery\nAnd good things\n\nI know\nYou will make it\nWe have to have\nFaith in you\n\nJust a line\nIn a diary\nA line in a book\n\nThat's how\nIt could be\nIt's your own choice\n\nThe anger is so clear\nBitter-sweet feelings with no care\nYou can make it happen some day\nBy morning you always see\nDays like bad memories\nYou can make it happen some day\n\n", "album": {"title": "Deadkidsongs_(2005)&&8838", "genre": "Emo", "year": 2005}}, {"title": "We'll Make It Away",

easy way out, even though it was hard for you\nI'm blaming you if it happens to her too\nI've heard that you were inside of all this pain\nYou passed it over to someone, so it can kill again\n\nBut I'm sure you had a damn good reason\nYou should have at least filled in the blanks\nWatching the nightsky, now she's all alone\nLooking for the star that is your new home\n\nNo way out of the inside,\nYou trapped her there\nNever to be the same again\nShe just inherited your pain\n\nI have faith, that she won't blame herself\nI guess you loved her, I know that she loved you\nDo you think she'll ever find someone new?\n\nBut I'm sure you had a damn good reason\nYou should have at least filled in the blanks\nWatching the nightsky, now she's all alone\nLooking for the star that is your new home\n\nI never knew you, I'm not sure I wanted to\nI never knew you, I'm not sure I wanted to\n\nAnd I hope that you had a damn good reason\nYou should have at least filled in the blanks\nYou left her here that night, she's on her own\nTrying to console her, but she feels alone\n\nBut I'm sure you had a damn good reason\nYou should have at least filled in the blanks\nWatching the nightsky,

back\n(It's the living truth that dies)\n\nIt's supposed to be a shiny day like this\nYou buried yourself too fast\nAnd all the happy things in life will be erased\nWe remember small things you have done\nThat were not obvious, not important to me\nWe didn't see what was going on\n\nDid you think of, them\nWhen deciding what to do with yourself\nHow could you say goodnight\n\nThousands will react\nWas that the point, the goal that you wanted to reach?\n\nYou\nGone forever\nLive\nIn memories\n\nWe're off for today\nWe're gone forever\n\nIt was not right (it's the living truth that
