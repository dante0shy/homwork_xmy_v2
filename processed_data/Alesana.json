\n\nBeg me to make this easier and listen as my hopeless cries\nSend stares into your meaningless eyes\n\nMy envy can't describe how I loathe you for having all the stars\nLeaving my eyes to marvel the sky knowing it should be mine\nYet it's you I see wasting the dream that only I deserve\nI'll tear off your face to see your smile.\n\nAs you build your dreams on my shattered hopes\nI'll look
