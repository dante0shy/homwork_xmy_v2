round the axle of greed,\nDon't let the economy stagnate\nFor it's our creed.\n\nI turn my head away in shame\nAs you crave for more,\nSelling out what is not yours to sell.\nWe're the pimps of it all.\n\nLiving in the decadence of our dignity.\nWhen silver waves his hand,\nWe kneel so eagerly.\nLiving in the decadence of our dignity.\nWhere man will take command\nWe'll sail astray in greed.\n\nCome into my booth and trade.\nWhat about the exclusive bargain\nFor the day?\nI can satisfy all your needs.\nSell your future and you will profit today,\nDo your deeds.\n\nI turn my head away in shame\nAs you crave for more,\nSelling out what is not yours to sell.\nWe're the pimps of it all.\n\nLiving in the decadence of our dignity.\nWhen silver waves his hand,\nWe kneel so eagerly.\nLiving in the decadence of our dignity.\nWhere man will take command\nWe'll sail astray in greed.\n\n", "album": {"title": "Chapters_From_A_Vale_Forlorn_(2002)&&3209", "genre": "Power

way\nJust like the birds will fly when autumn is here to stay.\nOne day they will return, come spring again that's when.\nBut we will never see our native country again.\n\nAt first we travelled through the English countryside\nOn tracks and on wagons as quickly as birds would fly.\nIt was a lovely sight to see the land at last\nBut all the glorious sights kept flashing by too fast.\n\nAnd later when we came to Liverpuddlian bay\nThe tears of regret finally started to have their say.\nThe hearts then started burning in each and everyone\nWe only talked of Sweden that used to be our home.\n\nWe all were packed together in one unhealthy cave\nIt was as if we'd stepped into an open grave.\nThe food that we had brought from blessed Swedish land\nWas suddenly forbidden and taken from our hand.\n\nAnd when we had been sailing for just a week or two\nA horrid kind of darkness was clouding our view.\nWe couldn't see each other and hardly breathe or walk\nIt was a gruesome anguish for all people aboard.\n\nThe air was filled with hunger and drenched in wretched cries,\nThe howling and the noises would pierce right through the skies\nAnd death became the ruler that forces us to our knees.\nThe dead were buried in the horrid fathom of the seas.\n\n", "album": {"title": "Chapters_From_A_Vale_Forlorn_(2002)&&3209", "genre": "Power Metal", "year": 2002}}, {"title": "Stand In

power from above the clouds,\nBlackening the sun away from sight.\n\nGaze in frustration as ground becomes a void,\nForcing you towards the jaws of sand.\nYour power is now shaken to it's foundation,\nAcross every acre of your land.\n\nFall to the ground after climbing so high,\nFall to your knees and yield for the sky.\nAs the primordial powers unveil from beyond time, nature prevails.\nYou can only stand in veneration.\n\nStare in astonishment as earth spits out its core,\nCovering your land in a burning wave.\nRun for cover if you can and save what can be saved,\nOr the wave will be your grave.\n\nBehold in amazement, inferiously you stand.\nThe air becomes a fire right before your eyes.\nThe sparkling flame of envy is setting you alight,\nAs Mother Nature cracks the sky.\n\nFall to the ground after climbing so high,\nFall to your knees and yield for the sky.\nAs the primordial powers unveil from beyond time, nature prevails.\nYou can only stand in
