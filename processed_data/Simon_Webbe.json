just know your life's gonna change\nGonna get a little further\nRight until the feelings change\n\nSo, is this how it goes?\nThink you've come this far with nothing to show\nThat ain't so, no\nYou don't see where you are\nAnd if you don't bother look back you know you'll never know\n\nCause you think that you've been living, just treading water\nAnd waiting in the wings for the show to begin\nBut I always see you searching\nAs you try that bit harder\nGetting closer, oh yeah, to the life you're imagining\n\n(I just know your life's gonna change)\nMaybe not today, maybe not today\nSome day soon you'll be all right\n(I just know your life's gonna change)\nDon't turn the other way, turn the other way\nFeels like luck is on your side\n(Just wanna live)\nNo worries, no worries\n(Don't wanna die)\nNo worries, no worries\n(Fight through the lows)\nSay it for me, say it for me\n(And take all the highs)\nWe all need somebody\n(Yeah we can sink)\nNo worries, no worries\n(Or can you swim)\nNo worries, no worries\n(Or walk on out)\nSay it for me, say it for me\n(Or jump right in)\nWe all need somebody\n\nSo, baby keep drifting on\nYour endeavors ain't just selfless wasted time\nSeek and find, yeah yeah\nYou're not that far from what you've hoped and wished for all along\nCause you think that you've been living, just treading water\nAnd waiting in the wings for the show to begin\nBut I always see you searching\nAs you try that bit harder\nGetting closer, oh yeah, to the life you're imagining\n\n(I just know your life's gonna change)\nMaybe not today, maybe not today\nSome day soon you'll be all right\n(I just know your life's gonna change)\nDon't turn the other way, turn the other way\nFeels like luck is on your side\n(Just wanna live)\nNo worries, no worries\n(Don't wanna die)\nNo worries, no worries\n(Fight through the lows)\nSay it for me, say it for me\n(And take all the highs)\nWe all need somebody\n(Yeah we can sink)\nNo worries, no worries\n(Or can you swim)\nNo worries, no worries\n(Or walk on out)\nSay it for me, say it for me\n(Or jump right in)\nWe all need somebody\n\nI just know your life's gonna change\nSay it for me, say it for me\nWe all need somebody\n\n", "album": {"title": "Sanctuary_(2005)&&3853", "genre": "Soul", "year": 2005}}, {"title": "Lay Your Hands", "href": "Lay_Your_Hands&&4734", "artist":

feel the world upon my shoulder\nEach time I'm standing out on the edge\nMy hopes have all deserted me\nLike their washed away in the sand\nAnd it's hurting my pride, trying to survive\nBut I know that I stand a chance when you lay your hands, oh yeah\n\n'Cause it's the only thing I have that still makes sense\n\nOh baby when I'm calling out, give me love and affection\nKeep telling me, showing me the way\nOh, If you see me falling down, lift me up from the shadows\nWill you take me away to a better place\nAnd when I'm in my darkest hour I need you by my side\nTo turn the tide till the suffering ebs\nLife is getting me down, getting me down close to defeat\nCome and lay your hands on me\n\nDo, what you do\nWhat you say, what you did\nDo what you do, put your hand on my head\n\nFeel this road is getting longer now and I'm too far away from home\nStill I've gotta keep on moving on but I can't do it on my own (not without you baby)\nBaby keeping me head above the water, help me swim from my life\nBecause the game is getting the harder, the strain is getting stronger\nAnd I can only face the fight when you lay your hands\n\nDo, what you do\nWhat you Say, what you did\nDo what you do, put your hand on my head\n\nOh yeah\n\n'Cause it's the only thing I have that still makes sense\n\nOh baby when I'm calling out, give me love and affection\nKeep telling me, showing me the way\nOh, If you see me falling down, lift me up from the shadows\nWill you take me away to a better place\nAnd when I'm in my darkest hour I need you by my side\nTo turn the tide till the suffering ebs\nLife is getting me down, getting me down close to defeat\nCome and lay your hands on me\n\nDo, what you do\nTill I'm healed again\nDo, what you do\nWhat you Say, what you did\nRediscovered my strength\nDo, what you do\nThose bitter blues are gone\nDo, what you do\n\nAll gone\nFeel the pain\nFeel the strain\nI'm falling\nLay your hands on\n\nOh baby when I'm calling out, give me love and affection\nKeep telling me, showing me the way\nOh, If you see me falling down, lift me up from the shadows\nWill you take me away to a better place\nAnd when I'm in my darkest hour I need you by my side\nTo turn the tide till the suffering ebs\nLife is getting me down, getting me down close to defeat\nCome and lay your hands on me\n\nDo, what you do\nWhat you say, what you did\nDo what you do, put your hand on my head\n\nDo, what you do\nWhat you say, what you did\nDo what you do, put your hand on my head\n\nBaby, do what you do, what you do\nCome and lay your hands on\nBaby, do what you do, what you do\n\n", "album": {"title": "Sanctuary_(2005)&&3853", "genre": "Soul", "year": 2005}}]
