his things took just what he could carry\nSaid goodbye I'm going away\nAnd there in the moment they thought it was strange\nQuite unusual to understand\nBut things aren't always what they seem to be\nAnd the picture he painted was not what he planned\n\nAnd he's gone as long as it will take him\nTo find a place to rest his crazy mind\nAnd he knows his will will not forsake him\nTill he finds the thing he's dreamin'\nEven though he knows that it's a\nLong long way\n\nHe listens to rivers and talks to the moment\nWhen nobody else is around\nHe lives in the creases between rhymes and reasons\nWhere magic and secrets are found\nHe looked at the desert and he saw the flowers\nOf meadows and mountains of blue\nHe's danced with the silence and held onto whispers\nAnd treasures each moment he's traveling through\n\nAnd he's gone as long as it will take him\nTo find a place to rest his crazy mind\nAnd he knows his will will not forsake him\nTill he finds the thing he's dreamin'\nEven though he knows that it's a\nLong long way\n\nAnd when he finds the gold\nThey'll come to him and circle him\nLike birds up in the sky\nTearing at the peace and joy he's found\n\nAnd he's gone as long as it will take him\nTo find a place to rest his crazy mind\nAnd he knows his will will not forsake him\nTill he finds the thing he's dreamin'\nWalking on what he believes in\nDeep inside his heart is screamin'\nEven though he knows that it's a\nLong long way\nLong long way\nLong long way\n\n", "album": {"title": "Live_A_Little_(2005)&&8285", "genre": "Rock", "year": 2005}},
