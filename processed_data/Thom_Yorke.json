blood?\nThen where's the blood?\n\nI'm coming home\nI'm coming home\nTo make it all right\nSo dry your eyes\n\nWe think the same things at the same time\nWe just can't do anything about it\nWe think the same things at the same time\nWe just can't do anything about it\n\nSo don't ask me\nAsk the ministry\nSo don't ask me\nAsk the ministry\n\nWe think the same things at the same time\nThere are so many of us\nSo you can't count\n\nCan you see me when I'm running?\nCan you see me when I'm running?\nAway from them\nAway from them\n\nI can't take their pressure\nNo one cares if you live or die\nThey just want me gone\nThey want me gone\n\nI'm coming home\nI'm coming home\nTo make it all right\nSo dry your eyes\n\nWe think the same things at the same time\nWe just can't do anything about it\nWe think the same things at the same time\n\nThere are too many of us\nSo you can't\nThere are too many of us\nSo you can't count\n\nIt has me led to the backroom\nHarrowdown Hill\nIt has me led to the backroom\nHarrowdown Hill\n\nIt was a slippery slippery slippery slope\nIt was a slippery slippery slippery slope\nI feel me slipping in and out of consciousness\nI feel me slipping in and out of consciousness\nI feel me\n\n", "album": {"title": "The_Eraser_(2006)&&2643", "genre": "Alternative Rock", "year": 2006}}, {"title": "Analyse", "href": "Analyse&&465", "artist": {"unique_name":
