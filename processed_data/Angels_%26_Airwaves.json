say\n\nI...\nI can do anything\nIf you want me here\nAnd I can fix anything\nIf you'll let me near\nWhere are those secrets now\nThat you're too scared to tell\nI'll whisper them all aloud\nSo you can hear your self\n\nGreen trees were the first sign\nThe deepest blue, the clearest sky\nThe silence came with the brightest eyes\nAnd turned water into wine\nThe children ran to see\nThe parents stood in disbelief\nAnd those who knew braced for the ride\nThe earth itself it came alive to say\n\nI...\nI can do anything\nIf you want me here\nAnd I can fix anything\nIf you'll let me near\nWhere are those secrets now\nThat you're too scared to tell\nI'll whisper them all aloud\nSo you can hear your self\n\nI'm sorry I have to say it but you look like you're sad\nYour smile is gone\nI've noticed it bad\nThe cure is if you let in just a little more love\nI promise you this \nA little's enough\nI'm sorry I have to say it but you look like you're sad\nYour smile is gone\nI've noticed it bad\nThe

too far\nFrom the point of suspense, we know it should be\nThe end of the part, of our favorite movie\nWhere the guy grabs the girl and gives her his hand\nSays take me away from this torturous land\nCause the grave is set up, the hole that I dug\nI gave and I gave and I gave and I gave you my trust\nLike the time that we kissed, and you gave me a lie\nTo add to this scene you pretended to cry\nBut I'm here and I'm cool, the way that it is\nJust give me a chance and I'll try to forgive\n\nAnd I don't know\nAnd I can't guess\nIf we're gonna be okay, but now\nMy last wish\nIs that you do this with me, kiss me here\nAnd hold my hand\nLet me feel like I'm the only one\nI know you can\nWon't you do it for me now\n\nI really had it with the rain of the tears\nThe predictable storm that has come every year\nAnd it sneaks in from shore with a bat in it's hand\nI'm trying I'm trying I'm trying I'm trying I can't\nYou're a thief and a witch, but I love you to death\nYou steal my heart and curse under your breath\nBut the one thing that I can most willing prove\nThat when you are gone I'll be fine without you\n\nAnd I don't know\nAnd I can't guess\nIf we're gonna be okay, but now\nMy last wish\nIs that you do this with me, kiss me here\nAnd hold my hand\nLet me feel like I'm the only one\nI know you can\nWon't you do it for me now\n\nNow just hold on, hold on to me\nHold on, hold on to me hold on to me\nHold on, hold on to me hold on to me\nHold on, hold on to me hold on to me\nHold on, hold on to me hold on to me\nHold on, hold on to me hold on to me\nHold on, hold
