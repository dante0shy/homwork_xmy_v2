your life's at stake\nWait till you beg forgiveness\nThis time I'll leave you for dead\n\nLoaded weapon, take a close look\nOpen eyes and you will see this tragedy\nMurder weapon, take a close

you from this cradle\nOf evil taking over\n\nLoaded weapon, take a close look\nOpen eyes and you will see this tragedy\nMurder weapon, take a close look\nOpen eyes and you will see the full

nightmare of masquerades in shades of grey\nI'm paralyzed by all the fear inside my head\nIs this how it's supposed to end?\nWith white light rushing in\n\nJust strap this ball and chain around my neck and choke me\nAnd I'll try to scream for help but the words just fade and whisper\nAnd you can hear my every thought and how it haunts me\nBut I'll fight with every ounce of strength that I have left\n\nIf I dream tonight, will I die too?\nAnd if I fall asleep, will I fade away?\n\nIt's just a dream, when everything you second guess\nIt's not my time to die, I will not leave tonight\nJust like the stories that they told\nAnd those demons want me now\n\nIf I dream tonight, will I die too?\nAnd if I fall asleep, will I fade away?\n\nWake up from this nightmare\nWake up from this lucid dream\nWake up from my real life\n\n", "album": {"title": "Pavour_Nocturnus_(2005)&&5445", "genre": "", "year": 2005}}, {"title": "Empty Promises", "href": "Empty_Promises&&1747", "artist":
