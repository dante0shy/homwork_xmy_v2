Tomorrow's just another day for you to lose... to come\nUnglued. You're reading letters, sitting, waiting for a call, you're\nSinging broken songs, just staring at the wall. You're finding comfort\nWhile you're dreaming of the fall. You'll start to hate yourself, and\nYou'll start to hate yourself.\n\nTell me nobody ever lies. Tell me nobody ever dies. We have plans to\nSort the mess inside when it's time to decide. You want to feel it.\nWe're so defeated. You've got to find a way to deal with the pain or\nYou'll be beat at your own game.\n\nYou said, \"I don't know where the time goes anymore. You know we're\nKicking bottles scattered on the floor. No opportunities are banging\nAt the door. That's why we swallow it, so we can breathe a little\nMore, no, no, no.\"\n\nTell me nobody ever lies. Tell me nobody ever dies. We have plans to\nSort the mess inside when it's time to decide. You want to feel it.\nWe're so defeated. You've got to find a way to deal with the pain or\nYou'll be beat at your own game.\n\nWell, office furniture around the papers, and you can't figure out how\nYou got run down. A fistful of pills is like a gun to your head, or\nSpend the rest of your days just chatting up the bar with a\nLie-littered glory story.\n\nTell me nobody ever lies. Tell me nobody ever dies. We have plans to\nSort the mess inside when it's time to decide. You want to feel it.\nWe're so defeated. You've got to find a way to deal with the pain or\nYou'll be beat -- at your own game, as your own game, all alone. You\nKnow you'll still be sleeping alone\n\n", "album": {"title": "A_New_Language_(2006)&&8917", "genre": "Pop Punk", "year": 2006}}]
