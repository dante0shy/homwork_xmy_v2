had their hearts tricked\nThe power surged\nThey had it ripped right out of their hands\n\nAnd now we're huddled here naked sore and alone\nAnd we can't see clear\n\nJust the thought of this is sickening\nTo live out all our years without you here\nJust the thought of this is sickening\n\nWe had our hearts tricked\nWe had it all worked out\nWe had the bad years planned in advance\n\nShe had

take\n\nIt's clear to me that you're the one\nWho won't tell lies or turn tail and run\nI know you're tired of feeling like we're under the gun\nJust hold on tight my lonely one\n\nThis isn't quite what you bargained for\nI know it stings to always prop up on someone whose own\nSelfish heart seems to be the one that's beating\n\nBut we would die if we just keep score\nJust give me time I know it feels like you've put\nEverything on hold but I swear I'll make this right\n\nHeaven knows I need you here\nBut hell's stoking up my hopeless fear\nOh god please just give this purgatory a little rest\n\n", "album": {"title": "Keep_Your_Heart_(2006)&&159", "genre": "", "year": 2006}}, {"title": "Over 50 Club", "href": "Over_50_Club&&2150", "artist": {"unique_name": "The_Loved_Ones"}, "lyrics":

nothing\nWalk away to burn it all down\n\nBut when the scissors got too dull\nAnd you had to make a choice\nWhether to fix what you'd done\nOr start it all again\n\nAnd when the light turns green\nOn your hopes and dreams\nDo you take right off or do you wait around?\nIt might turn red again\n\nAnd now you're hanging for these ropes\nAnd are you hopeless or well off?\nSo light up one more cigarette\nFor everything you left behind\nAnd burn it all down\n\n", "album": {"title": "Keep_Your_Heart_(2006)&&159", "genre": "", "year": 2006}}, {"title": "Breathe In", "href": "Breathe_In&&9434",
