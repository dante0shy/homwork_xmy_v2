gone there is silence\nYou can hear the sound of my heart break\nSee these arms, now they're empty\n'Cause they used to hold on to you\nI said I'd never let go\nBut somehow you slipped on through\nNow I know that's how love goes\nWhen love goes away\n\nI'm gonna cry some\nThen I'm gonna lay here and die some\nAll because I know there ain't no one else\nBaby, if I can't live with you\nGuess I'll have to\nLive with the lonesome\n\nThere's a prayer that I'm prayin'\nThere's a dream that I always will dream\nAnd the hope keeps me waiting\nFor the day when you come back to me\nIt's a curse and a blessing\nTo find love above all the rest\nNow I'd rather have nothing\nThan to settle for less\nNow I know that's how love goes\nWhen love goes away\n\n", "album": {"title":
