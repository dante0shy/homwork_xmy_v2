easily\n\nBelief is a beautiful armor\nBut makes for the heaviest sword\nLike punching under water\nYou never can hit who you're trying for\n\nSome need the exhibition\nAnd some have to know they tried\nIt's the chemical weapon\nFor the war that's raging on inside\n\nEveryone believes\nFrom emptiness to everything\nEveryone believes\nAnd no one's going quietly\n\nWe're never gonna win the world\nWe're never gonna stop the war\nWe're never gonna beat this\nIf belief is what we're fighting for\n\nWhat puts a hundred thousand children in the sand?\nBelief can\nBelief can\nWhat puts the folded flag inside his mother's hand?\nBelief can\nBelief can\n\n", "album": {"title": "Continuum_(2006)&&9159", "genre": "Blues Rock", "year": 2006}}, {"title": "In Repair", "href":
