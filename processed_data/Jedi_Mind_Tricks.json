man smashes, through ya skull with battle axes\nWe whip asses, with the jaunty daggers\nAnd smash this, crushing opposition like we was fascist\nStigmata and four gashes\nWe bashes, the faggots who can't attack it right\nTake they sternum and then turn 'em into my acolytes\nThat's the sight of blood, that make a child stop\nThat's the rights of thugs that keep it wild hot\nI hate you, say a prayer to a heavenly father\nIt's fatal, like a natal military armada\nWe hotter, warriors from Atlantis\nCouldn't overstand how raw the Hologram is\nThe mantis, who used the flame rod\nYou couldn't physically bruise the name God\n\n<b>[Hook x2- Ikon]</b>\nWe smash mics, and blast too precise\nAnd laugh as we cast the first stones at Christ\n\n<b>[Jus Allah]</b>\nWe born builders, as life takes it's toll\nLegends of the seven, embrace my soul\nTransported off the planet, by a supreme force\nAnd told to return on the day of Pentecost\nI bisect the ways between Heaven and Earth\nAnd scramble messages from God into your church\nDeception, blinds your perception\nMy reflection outshines the other colors in the spectrum\nThe brethren, I cease the peace corps\nWe follow street laws, engaged in Beast Wars\nThe visionary bombs, with military arms\nAimed at that motherfucker with pitchfork and horns\nI sent alchemy throughout the galaxy\nTo cause fire and ice, like Flames in Calgary\nYou're trapped in, the core of corruption\nLeft a fossil, in my path of destruction\n\n<b>*Voice sample*</b>\n\n<b>[Hook x2- Ikon]</b>\nWe smash mics, and blast too precise\nAnd laugh as we cast the first stones at Christ\n\n<b>[Ikon]</b>\nI am the man who lives above the force of good and evil\n<b>[Jus Allah]</b>\nThe man that handed down the powers to give to my people\n<b>[Ikon]</b>\nLive under laws of bald eagle\n<b>[Jus Allah]</b>\nThere's no tomorrow\n<b>[Ikon]</b>\nGet trapped with the trenchcoat killers in Colorado\n<b>[Jus Allah]</b>\nBlazin' spark, feeling certain my days are marked\nLive a life that conflicts with the ways I'm taught\n<b>[Ikon]</b>\nFuck it, we bring it hardcore, raw and ragged\nYa team must be hidin they balls, like a faggot\n<b>[Jus Allah]</b>\nI came with the light and gave sight to the sages\nBlack ink contained to write truth on white pages\n<b>[Ikon]</b>\nYou're sliced faceless\n<b>[Jus Allah]</b>\nSubjected to a massacre\n<b>[Ikon]</b>\nJedi Mind, bombin your MOVE like John Africa\n<b>[Jus Allah]</b>\nWe laugh at ya\n<b>[Ikon]</b>\nThe devil is the bomber\n<b>[Jus Allah]</b>\nWe unaffected as we protected by God's armor\n\n<b>[Hook x2- Ikon]</b>\nWe smash mics, and blast too precise\nAnd laugh as we cast the first stones at Christ\n\n", "album": {"title": "Violent_By_Design_(2000)&&4925", "genre": "Underground Hip Hop", "year": 2000}}, {"title":

Hologram\nYo, yo, yo, yo\n\n(Ikon the Hologram)\nAnother sacrificial lamb\nThat died at the hands of Hologram\nSent him into the dungeon and bludgeoned his fuckin' clan\nHoly lamb\nWho spit the live shit\nThe do or die, Illadelph Jedi Mind shit\nThe hot shit\nLive raps crack your jaw\nLike who's the avenger and who's at the center of war\nI left a scar\nSo your crabs would overstand\nMental will dent you and send you to a holy land\nLawnmower man\nSharp blades slash your vitals\nRecitals will fight you and entice you to burn Bibles\nHomicidal\nA Hologram burn churches\nMurders by stickin' a crucifix through your cervix\nDivine purpose, for the Remi that's in my thermos\nMy brain is evil stick you with needles that's hypodermic\nYou heard the verdict\nI'm with Allah 'cause he chose me\nBroke into the Vatican, strangled the Pope with his rosary\nWhat, what, what\n\n(Chorus repeat 4x)\nJedi Mind\nHeavenly Divine\nSteadily shine in '99\nWhat, what\n\n(Just Allah)\nMC's face terror wherever my sound's audible\nBanned from third world portals, battle mortals, and slaughter you\nSeen inside the visions of beyond\nThe dwellings of the Om\nExisting in Islamic pantheon\nFlows got degrees all my clothes got the scent of trees\nI lay back and blow sax like Kenny G\nPower blast wacking my path devour fast\nI leave you with the grain of sand in life's hourglass\nDevise your spell\nMake demons rise out of hell\nGrab you by your lapels and rob you of your outer shell\nYou feel the ill dire who sire in hellfire\nI launch writers\nPut your jaw on a Gauze wire\nJedi swordsman give rappers a foul fortune\nScience to contortion your body into a coffin\nInsane damage is done, you fuckin' with the army\nWe beat your skull to the shape of a wet bag of laundry\nWhat, yeah, yeah\n\n(Chorus repeat 4x)\n\n[Ikon] Yo, the gods are rhymin, they're traumatizin'\n[Jus Allah] Your feel poetic, law of the titans\n[Ikon] We like a fuckin' bolt of lightning\n[Jus Allah]The three wise men\n[Ikon] We at levels that defies men\n[Jus Allah] Watch out for fake heads deviled disguised men\n[Ikon] Arriving from the dawn and spawned with ill forms\n[Jus Allah] Battle leave you dead in the womb like stillborns\n[Ikon] The master herein\n[Jus Allah] The ominous, the master spirit\n[Ikon] Can't understand the language of rappers with bad lyrics\n[Jus Allah] Ikon the python\n[Ikon] Rappers are left strangled\n[Jus Allah] I overlook the Earth 'cause I see it from sun's angle\n[Ikon] Above the clouds\n[Jus Allah] We sit high and we daze, write a page, on how your enslaved to worldly ways\n[Ikon] Islamic marksmen\n[Jus Allah] Seeing the squad then...\n[Ikon] ... could be your fatal mistake\n[Jus Allah] Like the first sins of Adam in the garden\n[Ikon] You feel sorrow, I'm projected as god Apollo\n[Jus Allah] Explore realms, you left too confused to follow\n[Ikon] Invite your town to absorb the sniper rounds\n[Jus Allah] Illadelph, Shamballah, nigga stayin' underground\nWhat! Mothafuckers!\n\n(Chorus repeat 4x)\n\n", "album": {"title": "Violent_By_Design_(2000)&&4925", "genre": "Underground Hip Hop", "year": 2000}}]
