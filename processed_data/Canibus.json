Canibus)\nGenabis,\nThis is Genabis,\nRemember this,\n\n(Canibus)\nIn the beginning I discovered wordplay,\nI experimented with some syllables from the first to the third day\nOn the fourth, I searched for the words to say,\nHow to compress complex verbiage in the least amount of space,\nI was perfect at it and mastered the tactic,\nOn the fifth day I decided I would combine it with mathematics,\nOn the sixth day I became a fanatic,\nAnd I couldn't kick the habit, I would just look in the mirror and practice,\nOn the seventh cycle I had to take the day off,\nI was exhausted, I guessed my work would never pay off,\nBut if it happened to Him, it could happen to me,\nAnd if it happened to me it was destined to be,\n\n(Chorus x2: Canibus)\nYo, Genabis, Exobus, Levitibus,\nThere ain't a mic on this planet I'm restricted to touch,\nI read the Cosmos, what God wrote, predicted as much,\nThe inhabitants lack faith but resistance is tough,\n\n\n(Canibus)\nThey backslide back to church and call the minister's bluff,\nThey'd rather remain unenlightened than listen to 'Bus,\nI blew the fuck up, even though it was short and abrupt,\nI was the first rapper to ever close orbit the Sun,\nOne small step for man, one huge step for mankind,\nI am the Red Giant of rhymes,\nSolar deflectors incinerate you whole in one second,\nFlow is untested, those that I've threatened fold under pressure,\nAt one hundred and twenty beta cycles,\nHigh volts ignite your eyeballs until you see the fire in front of you,\nOptic cones and rods melt one at a time until you realize you're in Hell,\nRip the Jacker's not done with you,\nI terrorize the rap community with impunity,\nBlow you to pieces and move elusively through the debris,\nWhat my enemies want to do to me is old news to me,\nThose in pursuit of me will never get through to me,\n\n(Chorus x2: Canibus)\nYo, Genabis, Exobus, Levitibus,\nThere ain't a mic on this planet I'm restricted to touch,\nI read the 'Cosmos', what God wrote, predicted as much,\nThe inhabitants lack faith but resistance is tough,\n\n\n(Canibus)\nFirst rapper to speak over beats dogmatically,\nMixed with Elizabethan drama and tragedy,\nMy motto is to dress casually and live lavishly,\nLook at the Victorian tapestry and back at me,\nNotice the post-Renaissance pictures I drew,\nHand sketched drawings of the deserts in Nazca, Peru,\nThe following audio propagates the possible truth,\nTo prove I'm the illest so the choice is not up to you,\nSee, the standard ideological definition of a rap model\nPuts Canibus in scholarly periodicals,\nThe article is substantially impressive,\nMore than a message, a working thesis from several different perspectives,\nThe Rosetta Stone of sentences for rap music's tentative,\nEntered Apprentices this is Genabis,\nThe Rosetta Stone of sentences for rap music's tentative,\nEntered Apprentices this is Genabis,\n\n(Chorus x2: Canibus)\nYo, Genabis, Exobus, Levitibus,\nThere ain't a

precedence, complete par excellence,\nListen to the 'Levitibus' testament,\nTo understand me you need help,\nYou've got to see the film 'The Day After Trinity' written by Jon Else,\nTo understand that, you must know thyself,\nYou should keep listening 'cause Canibus' flow might help\n\n(Canibus)\nTo find the answers that we didn't know,\nMaybe Edgar Allen Poe's description of El Dorado is not so,\nSee, the reason there's no light at the end of the tunnel,\nIs 'cause we're really not in a tunnel we're trapped in a bubble,\nThe government hierarchy and the dregs of society,\nCan you explain why you believe Hell is fiery?\nWe're suffering from symptoms of drapetomania,\nSlavery isn't over it just took a new alias,\nThe Data Repository establishment and maintenance,\nAlmost turned me into an atheist scared of aliens,\nWhy write lyrics when I can make a better living,\nSelling freeze-dried venom to wildlife clinics,\n'Cause I hate the thought of being a predictable bore,\nOnce you get used to me you won't love me no more,\nThe 'Final Soliloquy of the Internal Paramour',\nWhat are we all to do when rap music is gone?\nI hope \"God and the imagination are one\",\nA golden tongue, can achieve synchronicity with the Sun,\nTranscended beyond the flesh and the blood, 'cause this is level one, \nAfter this album my message is done\n\n(Canibus)\nBut you can't battle me, so you'd rather embarrass me,\nI maintain dignity in the face of calamity,\nThey reach out their hand to me and talk dishonestly,\nBut I read through their syntactic structure like Noam Chomsky,\nA student so overzealous I motivate my trainers,\nI'd rather get some now than get some later,\nTake a break from writing rhymes on paper, recondition my character,\nChange my nature with seven days of Vipassana,\nLet go of the stress, man I was deeply depressed,\nSo famished, in fact, I needed a rest,\nTo regenerate my mind, \nBless the cornerstone of my rhyme with corn, oil and wine, \nThen see the light in a luminous paradigm,\nIt became more apparent with time,\nAll I had to do was follow the signs,\nTo be a better man I need help,\nI've just got to find the link between my inner deity and myself\n\n", "album": {"title": "Rip_The_Jacker_(2003)&&9228", "genre": "Hip Hop", "year": 2003}}, {"title": "Cemantics", "href": "Cemantics&&363", "artist": {"unique_name": "Canibus"}, "lyrics":
