say\nClose your ears and eyes, be on your way\n\nMist is swirling, creatures crawling\nHear the roar get louder in your ears\nYou know, the folly was your own\nBut the force behind can't conquer all your fears\n\nAnd if you want to stay for a little bit\nRest your aching limbs for a little bit\nBefore you, the night is beckoning\nAnd you know you can't delay\nYou hear the night birds calling you\nBut you can't catch the words they say\nClose your ears and eyes, be on your way\n\nPull your thoughts back many years\nTo the time when there was life with every morning\nPerhaps a day will come\nWhen the light will be as clear as on that morning\n\nAnd if you want to stay for a little bit\nRest your aching limbs for a little bit\nBefore you, the night is beckoning\nAnd you know you can't delay\nYou hear the night birds calling you\nBut you can't catch the words they say\nClose your ears and eyes, be on your way\n\n", "album": {"title": "Ummagumma_(1969)&&7800", "genre":

the road to ruin\nThe music played and played as we whirled without end\nNo hint, no word her honour to defend\n\n<i>\"I will, I will,\"</i> she sighed to my request\nAnd then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put to the test\nThen drowned in desire, our souls on fire\nI lead the way to the funeral pyre\nAnd without a thought of the consequence\nI gave in to my decadence\n\nOne slip and down the hole we fall\nIt seems to take no time at all\nA momentary lapse of reason\nThat binds a life for life\nA small regret, you won't forget\nThere'll be no sleep in here tonight\n\nWas it love, or was it the idea of being in love?\nOr was it the hand of fate that seemed to fit just like a glove?\nThe moment slipped by and soon the seeds were sown\nThe year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone\n\nOne slip and down the hole we fall\nIt seems to take no time at all\nA momentary lapse of reason\nThat binds a life to a life\nYou won't regret, you will never forget\nThere'll be no sleep in here tonight\n\nOne slip ... one slip\n\n", "album": {"title": "A_Momentary_Lapse_Of_Reason_(1987)&&276", "genre": "Rock", "year": 1987}}]
