lunged with the edge of a knife\nAnd as my blood formed a rose with the sweat from my nose\nOn the face of a China white plate\nI returned to a time when hope was our friend\nInstead of this bitch who we hate\n\nI fell to the tiles my face was all smiles\nThe sink overflowing a flood as sous chefs and waiters\nAnd vegetable traders all stood in the path of my blood\nI began to relax and slowly unwind and drift off as the maitre'd cried\n\"Well this is what happens when love starts to rot and poisons the dishwasher's mind\"\nI awoke to the sound of Monique calling out from her nightmarish

sea\nCries out for my blood tonight\n\nSeen the headlights of Vincent's car\nHe pulled his ride up slowly\nJust like God would\nNothing different from any Friday night\nWe sat and we smoked on his lukewarm hood\nSmall talk before the exchange\nIs Vincent's way of easing his own soul\nInto a spot in the dark parking lot\nOf a conscience that weighs\nMore than all the dope in this world\n\nHandful of chestnuts\nMouthful of April rain\nStomachful of two plain slices\nThe notes of life are hard to explain\nAn eyeful of lunchtime girls\nCloset full of red wine stains\nEarful of subway trumpet\nThe notes of life are all that remain\n\nTook out my money in fair due time\nTo hand to my man for a dance with his lady\nJust as the moon unholstered itself\nFrom a cop colored coat of a downtown cloud\nAnd Vince, he paused with his back to my face\nAnd that's when I heard the stones grind behind me\nYou don't need eyes on the back of your head\nTo tell you when you're done out loud\n\nAnd every vessel in my broken sea\nWalks out on my skin tonight\n\nFrom a rooftop up in the Bronx\nTonight I sweep down across my breathing city\nFeel so light\nThe taste of the night\nIs sweet gushing across my tongue\n\nThrough midnight smoke and skyscraper glow\nI descend down for to deliver\nThe final notes of a wharf rat's song\nTo my body floating in the river\n\nThe notes of
