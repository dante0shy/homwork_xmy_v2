again\nNovember sun is felt by none\nA chilly breeze has blown my thoughts to what's to come\nA cup of warm coffee, some vitamin C\nA bowl for the cat, a bowl for the dog, a bowl for me\nChoose my bluest tape and unlock my car\nAn honest tune with a lingering lead has taken me this far\n\nOn the edge of the porch in the warm evening night\nThrowing the bone for the dog I see two passing lights\nWell, I wonder where that driver's bound\nIs there someone, somewhere, someway out there that I've not found\nA touch of smoke ain't what it seems\nDust and sunshine can also make my eyes look mean\nBut there's a brown cat sleeping through this day's show\nToppin' off the woodpile, breathing slow\n\n", "album": {"title": "Space_Wrangler_(1988)&&6042", "genre": "Southern Rock", "year":

warm\nHe's such a changeable form in his very first year\n\nHe rides on to wrangler school\nWith a slingshot and a saddlebag of hand-me-down tools\nDoesn't want to look like a fool\nPass the jail without tears\n\nTime machines, remembered scenes\nThat a wrangler rides through a passing stream\nTime's replaced by a peaceful dream\nWrangler space\n\nHe reigns his pony to the gate of the school\nFeather pens and inkwells of hand-me-down rules\nLike trading a pony for an aging mule\nHe rides away without fear\n\nTime machines, new routines\nThat a wrangler rides through a passing dream\nAnd time's replaced by a peaceful stream\nSpace wrangler space\n\nHe gets off at a stranger's place\nWhere the girls dance different with familiar grace\nHe's knowing that he found the place\nThat pours the coldest beer\n\nSkol, very cold beer\nCheers, to your friends so near\nHigh, your dreams so clear\nRaise another glass to the dreams so near\n\n", "album": {"title":

of a clown just danced in and\nDid a few tricks and danced out again\nWarming a farmer's soul\n\nSummer was all there was\nWe were working, breathing heat\nTerror rising out of control\n\nThrough that door came a breeze\nWrapped on through our heads and around our spines\nCooling off the burning floor\n\nThe morning's breaking woke us long enough\nWe were sure we could see\nThe whole of some older birds\nRiding to the ground on the falling leaves\nRiding to the ground on some falling leaves\nOne last time\nOne last time\nTo feed\n\n", "album": {"title": "Space_Wrangler_(1988)&&6042", "genre":
