conviction to save these skies\n\nThe wind of the north seems pleasant and lush\nCompared to the chill in my eyes at the time\nThe wind of the north obey none but me\nCalm as the sun while deleting you all\n\nA withering process was programmed and set\nAnnihilation unfortunately inhibited itself\nIn the name of humanity the dissonance spread\nThe heavenly became so ripped and blurred\n\nDimensional rift that defines our existence\nFragile and weak while mankind lasts\nTo trigger the device that corrects and resets\nFocusing on routes, neglecting the past\n\n", "album":
