like to fill the ride with helpers\nThey like the way the 5's, slide on Drexler's\nThose 22's my nigga, I keep something in the ride for plexers\nGet it right, that's how we ride in Texas\nWe push slabs down here, 'cause we young stunners\nWe pull 'em out fast as a dick about to cum in a chick, with no rubber\nAnd the girls, like to follow the Coupe\n'Cause they amazed, by the way the trunk

I just stayed in school, and got a nice degree\nBut life for me, wasn't no knowledge from books\nIt was street game playa, and I got it from crooks\nSo when you boys want work, I got it to cook\nAnd
