you scream\nIn every breath, in every single motion\nBurning innocence the fire to set you free\n\nYour actions turn conquest to dust\nIn portents of fate you foolishly place trust\nSense fear in your broken breathing\nResort to shadows till your body expires\nAll creation has the promise of heaven\nAnd still you travel the road to hell\nI'm saying nothing for the good of myself\nBut I'm still talking and you're not listening\n\nIf I could change your mind\nI wouldn't save you from the path you wander\nIn desperation dreams any soul can set you free\nAnd I still hear you scream\nIn every
