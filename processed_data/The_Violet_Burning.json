harlot moves across the floor\nShe turns the handle on the door\n\nOne hundred eyes\nSeem to look right through her\nWhy she's there?\nThey're not sure\n\nBehind her love\nShe falls down to her knees\nWithout a word\nShe begins to weep\nAnd her tears\nFall down upon his feet\n\nAnd she smothers them\nWith kisses\nAnd she dries them\nWith her hair\n\nIn my life\nSorrow has kissed my lonely heart\nFear of man tears me apart\n\nAnd I've tried\nBut many times I've loved the world\nMany times I've been the whore\n\nI've cried a million tears\nMaybe more\nSo many times\nI have been the whore\n\nI will fall down\nOn my knees\nI will sing\n\"I love, my love\"\nI will weep\n\"I love, my love\"\n\nI will sing\n'Cause I love, my love\nAnd my tears will fall\nDown upon your feet\n\nLet me smother them\nWith kisses\nLet me dry them\nWith my hair\n\nIf I could be\nAnyone at all\nIf I could be\nAnyone at all\nLet me be\nThe whore at your feet\n\n", "album": {"title":

you gonna make up\nYour mind?\nAre you hearing me\n'Cause if I fell apart on you now\nYou would cave in, too\n\nMy heart is empty\nI need to be filled\nCome take these tears\nJust one last time\nWithin your wings\nHelp me to fly\nI'm waiting for you\nI'm ready for you to be real\nI'm ready\nTo fall apart\nFeel me slipping\nFall apart\n\nIt's time to let go\nTime to be real\nI'm taking my hands off\nThe steering wheel\nI'm ready to fall apart\nReady to fall apart, baby\nIt'll break your fucking heart\nYour miserable heart\nOh, I got your fever\nI got your fever\nI feel it inside me, sickened\nSickened\nTemperature rising, sickened,\nSickened\nI got your fever\n\n", "album": {"title": "The_Violet_Burning_(1996)&&2581", "genre": "", "year": 1996}}, {"title": "Sweet Mercy", "href":
