I hear them devouring\nPest-ridden jackals of the earth\nDiabolical beasts and roaming the forests\nIn wait and constant protectors\nCalling you to sit by his side\nYour self-loathing image in his flesh\nA revelation upon which you linger\n\nHis words are flies\nSwarming towards the true insects\nFeasting on buried dreams\nAnd spreading decay upon your skin\nHis eyes spew forth a darkness\nThat cut through and paralyze\nCasts light upon your secrets\nForced to confront your enemies\n\nHis mouth is a vortex\nSucking you into its pandemonium\nFools you with a helping hand of ashes\nReached out in false dismay\nHis body is a country\nThe cities lay dead beyond despair\nFriends turned enemies unable to come clean \nIn a rising fog of reeking death\n\nEverything you believed is a lie\nEveryone you loved is a death-burden\nSo you take comfort in him\nAnd you are receptive to stark wishes\nNo longer struggling to declare your stand\nYou would inflict no harm to others\nThey are unaware and in a loop of futile events\nYou are everything, they are nothing\n\nDrown in the deep mire\nWith past desires\nBeneath the mire\nDrown desire now with you\n\nLined up verses on dead skin\nThe tainted lips of a stranger \nResting upon hers\n\nAnd I embrace bereavement\nEverything beloved is shattered anyway\nI would devote myself to anyone\nI would accept any flaws\n\nI am too weak to resist\nTension vibrating with horror\nFinding the outcast in my eyes\nPushing nerves on a puppet\nEndless poison in my veins\nClean intent now tainted with death\n\nAnd so, cold touch now inhumane\nEvery waking hour\nAwaiting a reverie to unfold\nLouder by the minute\nThe baying of the hounds\nCalling me back to my home\n\n", "album": {"title": "Ghost_Reveries_(2005)&&7080", "genre":

aching\n\nThere's a certain detail seen here\nThe pen must have slipped to the side\nAnd left a stain\nNext to his name\nShe\nKnows he's gone\n\nAnd isolation\nIs all that would remain\n\"The wound in

voice\nNature's way struck grief in me\nAnd I became a ghost in sickness\n\nWillingly guided into heresy\nBeneath the surface, stark emptiness\nAnd you'd pity my conviction\nWhereas I thought of myself as a leader\n\nYou'd cling to your pleasant hope\nIt is twisted fascination\nWhile I'd ruin the obstacles into despair\nAnd I'm praising death\n\nLost love of the heart\nIn a holocaust scene memory\n\nDecrepit body wearing transparent skin\nInside, the smoke of failure\n\nWept for solace and submit to faith\nIn his shadow I'm choking\nYet flourishing\n\nMaster\n\nA delusion made me stronger\nYet I'm draped in pale withering flesh\nI sacrificed more than I had\nAnd left my woes beneath the mire\n\n", "album": {"title": "Ghost_Reveries_(2005)&&7080", "genre": "Progressive Death
