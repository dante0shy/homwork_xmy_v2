strange\nHe's still a bachelor, perhaps he's gay\n\nA corpse is laid out neatly on a slab\nProfessor's working madly in his lab\nThe assistant files her nails and checks her hair\nThere's just a hint of danger in the air\n\nThere's just a hint of danger in the air\nNo one is alarmed nor seems to care\nEveryone is happy, we're all fine\nWe all fall in love all the time\n\nYeah, we all fall in love or from a plane\nWith the stewardess, she serves us in our dreams\nWhen we wake, we find that it has rained\nWhen it rains, it lulls us back to sleep\n\nSo rest your weary eyes and go to sleep\nOr rest your weary head and come to me\nMove your lips and sing this lullabye\nMove your lips and sing this
