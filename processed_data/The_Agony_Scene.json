bleeding mass in procession\nThat fell on the path from which it strayed\n\nA whisper in total darkness\nTo die at the hands of what we are\nA breath escapes from the lifeless\nThe blind and the feeble of our decay\nThis is the pain we must suffer\nThis is the endless agony\nThis is the darkest of secrets we give our lives to keep\n\nThe light that's surrounding\nI am all that you've made me\nTheir endless desire feeds the fire inside me and all I can ask for\nTake this life that you gave me\nI'm not your Messiah\nThe fear that grows like a cancer\nHeld likes a breath and sacrificed\n\nThe blood that flows from the wounded\nConsumed by the masses who've longed to taste\nThis is a prayer for the hopeless\nThis is an endless tragedy\nThis is the darkest of secrets\nWe give ourselves to keep\n\nThe light that's surrounding\nI am all that you've made me\nTheir endless desire feed the fire inside me and all I can ask for\nTake this life that you gave me\nI'm not your Messiah\nI pray for redemption\n\nThese unanswered cries\nIn darkness it came to me and I breathe\nTheir distant voices sing to me and everything changes suddenly\n\nThe light that's surrounding\nI am all that you've made me\nTheir endless desire feeds the fire inside me and all I can ask for\nTake this life that you gave me\nI'm not your Messiah\n\n", "album": {"title":
