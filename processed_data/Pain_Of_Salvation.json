you\n\nI never knew your name but I will miss you just the same\nI was to live for you\nI lost the will to live at all the day you came\nIt'll never be the same but I will love you just the same\nYou were to be the first, how wonderful\nNow I will always fear to hope again\n\nThe irony\nOf seeing me whispering through her skin\nSo joyfully\nTo our child there deep within\nOr of when she called to me\nTo tell me cheerfully\nThat she had seen your shape\nOn a hospital screen\nAnd of nurses being concerned\nThat you never moved or turned\nToo late we see the warnings\nToo late we learn\n\nI never saw your face and now you're gone without a trace\nExcept the trace of blood that's deeply scarred into my eyes\nTo fill your place\nIt'll never be the same but I will love you just the same\nI was prepared to be your father\nHow can I ever prepare for that again?\n\nStill I follow that trace of blood\nAlways leading back to you\nHollow years of damming that flood\nTwo young souls in misery\nMissing you\nMissing you\n\n", "album": {"title": "Remedy_Lane_(2002)&&6403", "genre": "Progressive Metal", "year": 2002}}, {"title": "Her Voices", "href": "Her_Voices&&7864", "artist":

that shame\nOf pushing her down\nOf kids and her games\nTheir strongholds\n\nWe had a bigger world\nWe had a better view\nI guess I never fully realized then\nWhat she lost when I cut that loss\n\nSo she filled the void\nWith unearthly friends\nVoices of hers\nGreater\n\nWe had a bigger world\nWe had a better view\nI wish she'd never told us about her voices\nWe were strong, we were much too strong\n\n(Never forgive) No!\n(Never forget) Never forget\n\nWe picked and pierced, we ripped and we tore\nWe hit and we scratched to make in her a hole\nGlares and eyes, whispers and notes\nAttached to her every pose\n\n(We fed her shouts)\n(For the collection of her voices)\n(I was too weak to collect)\nTheir ugly truth\nOutnumbered by far her beautiful dream\n(But so it turned out)\nAnd I closed my eyes\n(Was she both paid in soul)\nWere her eyes in yours already when we met?\n(For the cutting of that loss)\nAm I still paying debts to recover life?\n\nNow I can see she proved to be right\nAs she was called down\nIt's sad though\nThat I turned out to be one of her voices\n\n", "album": {"title": "The_Perfect_Element_(2000)&&4292", "genre": "Progressive Metal", "year": 2000}},

find some peace of mind\nSometimes we need to walk alone\n\nShe is set on running away\nThough her mom was yelling she must stay\nA wind beaten bird for reasons unheard\nSometimes it is best to run away\n\nSo fly away, fly away, fly away\nDon't be afraid, don't hesitate, fly away\n\nSome wear their bruises on their skin\nOthers hide their scars deep within\nShe has a wound close to her womb\nBlames herself for letting it in\n\nSo fly away, fly away, fly away\nDon't be afraid, don't hesitate, fly away\n\nBut she's afraid, she's afraid, she's afraid\nAnyway\nSee those eyes, see those eyes, see those eyes\nHate and lies, a fire that slowly dies\nBut she will fly, she will fly, she will fly\nBefore it dies\n\nSometimes the hands that feed\nMust feed a mind with a sick need\nAnd the hands that clutch can be\nThe same hands that touch too much\nEyes that hungrily stare\nRead in an access that's not there\nWhile eyes close to hide tears\nOr look away in fear\nRun away\n\nPassing the open stores\nHiding her dirty sores\nSeeking asylum among freaks and whores\nWhat wouldn't she give to be\nIn a society\nNot learning the eyes to be closed but to see\n\nNow she bites the words (Never)\nShe kicks the ground (Never)\nSwallows her tears (Never will I go back)\nShe hits the walls (Leave me)\nScratches herself (Leave me)\nBegs to all Gods (Rip me from this sick flesh)\n\n(I will always be there)\nNo, she holds her ears\n(You know that I love you)\nPretends that she doesn't hear\n(We're in this together)\n(We share the same skin)\nPanic in his voice now\nFree us from sin\n\n(Tell me that you love me) This is the end\n(I know that you do) Of her way\n(Never ever again) Follow me down\n\n(God forgive this hunger) Please mommy see\n(Never tell a soul) Is it me\n(A child will love its parents) Will follow them down\n\nShe swears to the pavement's heart of stone\nThat these city lights will be her home\nBut still as they burn she will return\nBack to the adults of her home\n\n", "album": {"title": "The_Perfect_Element_(2000)&&4292", "genre": "Progressive Metal", "year": 2000}}, {"title": "Morning On Earth", "href": "Morning_On_Earth&&3581", "artist":

as I hear you\nBreathing here when you sleep between these morning sheets\n\nI am the tears in your mouth\nI am the weight on your shoulder\nI am the scream that wants out\nAnd my heart just couldn't grow colder\nNow this rusty heart is my gift\nThis fallen love is my rift\n\nMorning arrives on an Earth I've never seen before\nRevealing a life that I never really understood\nStrange, the way beauty can hurt the unopened eye\nMuch more than all of the filth and pain\nThat we're soaked in ever could\n\n(I am the tears in your mouth)\nHow it's hurting me\n(I am the weight on your shoulder)\nTo suddenly see\n(I am the scream that wants out)\nWhat I have become\n(And my heart just couldn't grow colder)\nYou must always be there\n(Now this rusty heart is my gift)\nWe are still on the sidewalks\n(This fallen love is my rift)\n\nHear this voice, see this man standing before you\nI'm just a child trapped inside the body of a man\n\nA acquaintance, so oddly old - bred not to love\nSuffers the beaten grounds of Idioglossia\nWe talk but we do not speak\nTogether only in our incapability to leave this fallen playground\nWe rule this Empire merely with these few crippled toys\nRust in our faces\nThis is what we can share\nThis is all we can lose\nStill, furiously we will linger to it with our lives\nCling to its rust and pains\nBarefoot and torn\nBred not but born to love\n\nHear this voice, see this man standing before you\nI'm just a child trapped inside this fallen man\nSee this child\n\n", "album": {"title": "The_Perfect_Element_(2000)&&4292", "genre":
