I stared at my shoes in the ICU\nThat reeked of piss and 4-Oh-9\nAnd I rationed my breaths as I said to myself\nThat I'd already taken too much today\nAs each descending peak on the LCD\nTook you a little farther away from me\nAway from me\n\nAmongst the vending machines and year-old magazines\nIn a place where we only say goodbye\nIt stung like a violent wind\nThat our memories depend\nOn a faulty camera in our minds\nAnd I knew that you were a truth\nI would rather lose\nThan to have never lain beside at all\nAnd I looked around\nAt all the eyes on the ground\nAs the TV entertained itself\n\n'Cause there's no comfort in the waiting room\nJust nervous pacers bracing for bad news\nThen the nurse comes round\nAnd everyone lifts their head\nBut I'm thinking of what Sarah said:\n\n\"Love is watching someone die.\"\n\nSo who's gonna watch you die?\n\nSo who's gonna watch you die?\n\nSo who's gonna watch you die?\n\n", "album": {"title": "Plans_(2005)&&1006", "genre":

the sun wrap its arms around me and\nBathe my skin in water cool and cleansing and feel\nFeel what it's like to be new\n\n'Cause in my head\nThere's a Greyhound station\nWhere I send my thoughts\nTo far-off destinations\nSo they may have a chance\nOf finding a place where they're\nFar more suited than here\n\nI cannot guess what we'll discover\nWhen we turn the dirt with our palms cupped like shovels\nBut I know our filthy hands can wash one another's and not one speck will remain\n\nI do believe it's true\nThat there are roads left in both of our shoes\nBut if the silence takes you\nThen I hope it takes me, too\n\nSo, Brown Eyes, I'll hold you near\n'Cause you're the only song I want to hear\nA melody softly soaring through my atmosphere\n\nWhere soul meets body\nWhere soul meets body\nWhere soul meets body\n\nAnd I do believe it's true\nThat there are roads left in both of our shoes\nBut if the silence takes you\nThen I hope it takes me, too\n\nSo, Brown Eyes, I'll hold you

about which side I was on, mmhmmm\n\n'Cause I built you a home in my heart\nWith rotten wood and it decayed from the start\n\n'Cause you can't find nothin' at all\nIf there was nothin' there all along\nNo, you can't find nothin' at all\nIf there was nothin' there all along\n\nI braved treacherous streets\nAnd kids strung out on homemade speed\nAnd we shared a bed in which I could not sleep\nAt all, woohoo, woohoo-oo-oo-oo\n\n'Cause at night the sun and the tree\nMade the skyline look like crooked teeth\nIn the mouth of a man who was devouring us both\n\nYou're so cute when you're slurring your speech\nBut they're closing the bar and they want us to leave\n\nAnd you can't find nothin' at all\nIf there was nothin' there all along\nNo, you can't find nothin' at all\nIf there was nothin' there all along\n\nI'm a war of head versus heart\nAnd it's always this way\nMy head is weak\nMy heart always speaks\nBefore I know what it will say\n\nAnd you can't find nothin' at all\nIf
