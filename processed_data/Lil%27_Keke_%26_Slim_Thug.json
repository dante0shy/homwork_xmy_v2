and I stay on dine\nNow my stash a lil thicker, this the best of my years\nI'm getting cash a lil quicker, than the rest of my peers\nMaking work disappear, from the knowledge I keep\nMaking a million a year, without a college degree\nI'm a Down South boss, holding down my title\nTrying to take my position, it'll get homicidal\nGet out of line with the boss, I paid what it cost\nMy fee is five thee, to get you bumped off\nMy click raw in that Dirty, break a law in the Dirty\nQuick to break a fake hater jaw, in the Dirty Dirty\n\nThis is how we do in the Dirty ha\nRoll chrome twenty inch, blades in the Dirty ha\nCandy paint dripping, Escalade in the Dirty ha\nThis is how we do the damn thang, in the Dirty ha\nThis is how we do in the Dirty ha\nGet the thang crunk, down here in the

bop\nI'm Lil' Keke the Don, just a young phenomenon\nFive or six bank accounts, two or three for my son\nYou know anything goes, when you riding through the Dirty\nSucker free for life, making sure you punks heard me\nI'ma get mine, hit licks for heavy bricks\nNext do' to Mexico, I get it thirteen six\nWhat you working for, feddy and chips or new cars\nH-Town Texas, we born to be stars\nA mastermind, I get paid and live splendid\nPlatinum in the ghetto, you a hundred independent\nI'm a young G, and ain't no playing with me\n'Cause I multiply the game, got a balling degree\nWhen I mash on a broad, gotta do it with pride\nCause this the Dirty Dirty, you know the Dirty Southside\n\n(DJ dmd)\nWe got big money, big cars, big checks, big chains\nBig booty broads, giving a playa big brain\nIn the 2000 and 2, Cadillac Coupe\nSitting on 22's, with the head out the roof\nThird Coast, thangs start down here\nIn starched out gear, nigga that started down here\nAin't you know we hit the do', 33 deep\nAnd haters with plex, we put they whole block to sleep\nTre to the herb, stay with the syrup\nHitting the club, with big Burb's on the curb\nBirds flying away, for fifteen-five a lick\nUncut, nigga the game is thick\nWith big ballas like me, DJ DMDeezie\nHandcuff your broad, call the laws when you see me\nFa sheezie, we on the grind 25-8\nAnd bitch ass niggaz, that get tossed
