tied to you\nI fell apart, that's what I always do\n\nThis ain't about regret\nMy conscience can't be found\nThis time I won't repent\nSomebody's going down\n\nFeel it now and don't resist\nThis time the anger's better than the kiss\nI must admit when so inclined\nI tend to lose it than confront my mind\n\n'Cause it don't bleed and it don't breathe\nIt's locked its jaws and now it's swallowing\nIt's in our heart, it's in our head\nIt's in our love, baby, it's in our bed\n\nTonight I go to hell\nFor what I've done to you\nThis ain't about regret\nIt's when I tell the truth\n\nAnd once again the monster speaks\nReveals his face and searches for relief\nA little boy is tied to you\nAttracted only till it comes unglued\n\nAnd it don't bleed and it don't breathe\nIt's locked its jaws and now it's swallowing\nIt's in our heart, it's in our head\nIt's in our love, baby, it's in our bed\n\nTonight I go to hell\nFor what I've done to you\nThis ain't about regret\nIt's when I tell
