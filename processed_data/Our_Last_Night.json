I think I've finally broken free\nI've finally finished this boring movie, but thank you for casting me\nAnd for this somewhat shocking ending\nI'm not good at this whole main character thing\nNow I look back at this bridge I crossed after I've strapped dynamite\nTo the supports and given the signal to the wrecking ball\nWe yell lets blow this to pieces. We demolish it\nI couldn't go back if I wanted to, so we learn something new everyday\nThis confusing thing is getting old\nOh come on, you gotta love when certain people play games when no one else wants play\nOh, and I almost forgot that none of this matters anymore... and I couldn't careless\nWhy can't anyone ever get that right? I did the telling, you did the wrecking\nDon't worry, I'm not mad, things turned out just fine\nBut while were on the subject of wrecking, I'll sign the papers to finish this\nAnd while you're doing God knows what with who gives a shit, I'll be happy now\n\"I could tell you what I'm thinking, but it could wreck what we have\"\nAnd come to think of it, I was right all along\n\n", "album": {"title": "Building_Cities_From_Scratch_(2005)&&2017", "genre": "Metalcore", "year": 2005}}, {"title": "I'll Be Breathing", "href": "I%27ll_Be_Breathing&&2992", "artist": {"unique_name": "Our_Last_Night"}, "lyrics": "Don't come back looking for more\n'Cause it's now or never in this world\nYou can tell yourself not to hold back\nBut sooner or later you'll break\n\nI'll be breathing, you'll be bleeding\nJust spill out everything\nAnd try to patch up your scars (And try to patch up your scars)\nWe used to be the greatest (Everything, like fire to a match)\nAnd we will never be what I hoped\nSo I've stopped wishing and hoping now\n\n(I can't think of you 'cause these dreams are through)\nI can't think of you 'cause these dreams are through\n('Cause these dreams are through)\n\nI'll be breathing, you'll be bleeding\nJust spill out everything\nAnd try to patch up your scars (And try to patch up your scars)\nWe used to be the greatest (Everything, like fire to a match)\nAnd we will never be what I hoped\nSo I've stopped wishing and hoping now\n\nWishing and hoping now\n\nI'll be breathing, you'll be bleeding\nJust spill out everything\nAnd try to patch up your scars (And try to patch up your scars)\n\nI'll be breathing, you'll be bleeding\nJust spill out everything\nAnd try to patch up your scars\n\n(Screamer)\nYou used to be so great\nYou used to be the greatest one out of every one\n\nI'll be breathing, you'll be bleeding\nJust spill out everything\nAnd try to patch up your scars (And try to patch up your scars)\nWe used to be the greatest (Everything, like fire to a match)\nAnd we will never be what I hoped\nSo I've stopped wishing and hoping now\n\n", "album": {"title": "We%27ve_Been_Holding_Back_(2004)&&3032", "genre": "Metalcore", "year": 2004}}, {"title": "Nothings Says \"I Love You\" Like A Restraining Order", "href": "Nothings_Says_%22I_Love_You%22_Like_A_Restraining_Order&&4336", "artist": {"unique_name": "Our_Last_Night"}, "lyrics": "Here's to discarding the evidence, it's an art.\nIt's what the absence of a motive can do to you.\nSometimes people are better left to themselves.\nSo excuse anything that I'm about to say,\nIt's just this conscience that does all the talking.\nBaby you're my shining star.\nStop, think, act, review.
