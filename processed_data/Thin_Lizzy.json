There's millions of them!\"\n\nI've seen a fire start in 'Frisco\nThe day that the earth quaked\nI've seen buildings a-blazing\nThrowing up in flames\n\nI heard men, women and children crying out\nTo their God for mercy\nBut their God didn't listen\nSo they were burned alive\n\nThey went down, down, deep underground\nIn the great disaster\n\nI was hanging out in Berlin\nIn the year one thousand nine hundred and thirty nine\nI've seen Hitler's storm troopers\nMarch right across the Maginot Line\n\nI've seen two world wars\nI've seen men send rockets out into space\nI foresee a holocaust\nAn angel of death descending to destroy the human race\n\nDown, down, deep underground\nA great disaster\n\nIn the sixteenth century\nThere was a French philosopher\nBy the name of Nostradamus\nWho prophesied\nThat in the late twentieth century\nAn angel of death shall waste this land\nA holocaust\nThe likes of which this planet had never seen\nNow, I ask you\nDo you believe this to be true?\n\nI was standing by the bedside\nThe night that my father died\nHe was crying out in pain\nTo his God he said, \"Have mercy, mercy\"\n\nHis body was riddled with a disease\nUnknown to man, so he expected no cure\nBut before he died that night\nHe was lost, insane\n\nHe went down, down, deep underground\nA great disaster\n\nYou'll go down, down, deep underground\nA great disaster\n\nYou'll go down, down...\nDeep underground...\n\n\"I think they're gone now.\"\n\n", "album": {"title": "Renegade_(1981)&&9553", "genre": "Hard Rock", "year": 1981}}]
