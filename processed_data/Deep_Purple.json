more\nI'm always takin' the lead\n\nOld man shakin' dice down on the street\nTry'n to make a livin' somehow\nBut I'm really sure about gettin' things sorted out\nAnd I'm gettin' ready right now\n\nYou can't hold me\nI have told you\nMight just take your life\nMight just take your life\n\nI've been called by many names\nAnd all of them are bad\nI can take it all the same\nIt's all I've ever had\n\nI've got somethin' that you can't get\nBut one thing you can see\nGettin' there ain't easy\nBut it sure was hard for me\n\nYou can't hold me\nI have told you\nMight just take your life\nMight just take your life\n\nEvery time I take a look\nThere's someone close behind\nThey never used to make a pass\nThe things that crossed their minds\n\nNow they tell me that it's all right\nAnd they want to be my friend\nThey're ridin' on my back\nWhen is it goin' to end?\n\nYou can't hold me\nI have told you\nMight just take your life\nMight just take your life\nMight just take your life\n\nGot

the year is growing older\nI see winter on my shoulder\nI stand in the haze\nWatching stone-made ripples grow on my own\nNever knew you were needed\nTill I found myself standing here alone\n\nAnd in the water, such a sad face\nSlowly drowning, such a sad face\nIf only I could change the seasons\nLike a poet, hide my reasons\nIt started to snow in the middle of July\nWonder why\nNever did understand you\nMy sorrow is hanging in the grey sky\n\nIn the summer days we flew to the sun\nOn melting wings\nBut the seasons changed so fast\nLeave us all behind\nBlind\n\nBut then the stone fell on the water\nPutting end to summer's daughter\nAnd me, I turn away remembering\nAll the seasons, such a sad thing\nIt started to rain in the middle of the sun\nWinter's begun\n\nNever did understand you\nMy sorrow is hanging in the grey sky\n\nIn the summer days we flew to the sun\nOn melting wings\nBut the seasons changed so fast\nLeave us all behind\nBlind\n\n", "album": {"title":

wondered why\n\nIf I'm cold, I need some heat\nIf I'm hungry, then I eat\nI'm not responsible\n\nI woke up this morning and I couldn't find my shoes\nIt's one long party and I haven't seen the sun for days\nI'd take you out tonight, but I'm just a little light\nSo let's go out anyway, you'll be amazed\n\nI take my woman to the palace dancing\nI never coulda made it but the doorman is a friend of mine\nSo I raise a glass to you, the foot is on the other shoe\nYou can pay the bill and while you're at it, pick up mine\nOh, no no, I don't mind\n\nIf it rains, I stay inside\nIf I'm scared, I run and hide\nI'm not responsible, oh no\n\n", "album": {"title": "Perfect_Strangers_(1984)&&7900", "genre": "Hard Rock", "year": 1984}}, {"title": "Jack Ruby", "href": "Jack_Ruby&&4442", "artist":
