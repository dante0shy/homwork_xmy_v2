standing clear\n'Cause all I waited for is\n\nClosing in\nStill got twenty four hours\nWe're closing in\nStill got twenty four hours\n\nThis is more than daily bread\nIt's three degrees, it's something else\nAnd you just take it all into your stride\nCouldn't be an accident 'cause I can't see no ambulance\nI know that we will work it out this time\n\nAnd it's caught wide screen so we don't miss a thing\nNow I'm standing clear\n'Cause all I waited for is\n\nClosing in\nStill got twenty four hours\nNow we're closing in\nStill got twenty four hours\n\nClosing in\nStill got twenty four
