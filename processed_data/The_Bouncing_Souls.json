her along\nThrough a broken world that changes every day\nBut inside Sarah's head everything's okay\n\nSarah Saturday, you radiate\nAnd nothing in this world is wrong\nSarah Saturday, like a perfect song\nMakes me want to sing along\n\nBurning down the world of lies\nWith just one glance from those clear blue eyes\nHolding onto the truth\nWith some quiet strength inside\n\nShe gives me hope for better times\nThank you, Sarah, for showing me\nThe strength to free my mind\nRise above these troubled times\n\nWriting words to the music in my head\nIt's a perfect song moving me along\nIn a broken world that changes every day\nYou make me feel like everything's okay\n\nSarah Saturday, you radiate\nAnd nothing in this world is wrong\nSarah Saturday, like a perfect song\nMakes me want to sing

soundless and still\nA girl collapses on her bed, writing words never read\nTroubled youth spills over into troubled life and times\nWe walk along with our troubled minds\n\nA guitar strikes a chord, hits a misery so hard, so bold\nSounding through this world where it's so hard to feel that gold\nIt's running through a song of beauty buried deep under a river of greed\nWhere the muddy waters flow and the stones don't roll\n\nThis is for all the unheard, all the music left behind\nAll the songs left on the floor in the closets of our minds\nWhere's the passion gone in our hearts, lost somewhere in the grind?\nIt's time to bring it back, it's time to unwind, find what we lost, it's time\nIt's time to bring it back\n\nA lost song lingers on\nBouncing off stars on and on\nA moment gone, or is it looking for you\nTo sing its tune?\n\nTroubled youth spills over into troubled life and times\nWe walk alone with our troubled minds\n\nThis is for all the unheard, all the music left behind\nAll
