niggaz rhyme like they AK spray shit\nSell a ki of yay shit, gotta ride, homicide, every single day shit\nGet smacked in the streets by some real nigga who don't play shit\nHit the pavement screaming it's just entertainment\nAnd that ain't it, life sucks like fumigation\nMy obligation, expose all you funny bunnies\nRappers acting slash fudge packing for the money\n'Cause next week if the new fad

greatest secrets\nThat the record industry tried to hide\nDue to lack of promotion and scandalous intentions\nPriest was forced to take his album underground\nAnd now he will no longer suffer\nReviewing this album, you gotta ask yourself why\nLook at every song, and I'mma let you decide\nHe is one of the greatest MC's, ever to roam this planet\n\n(Killah Priest)\nFather forgive me, it's the Henny or Remi\nOr maybe it's the many of fame, this world planted in me\nWhen I was just a child, I was misunderstood\nTill I saw your finger in the cloud, I was picked from the hood\nI was in the myst of a crowd, when shit wasn't good\nTill I heard your voice out loud, then I lifted it good\nDoctors wouldn't tell me, the teachers would often fail me\nAnd for a grown child, that shit, just wasn't healthy\nWhen the bitches hadn't dealt me, never planned to help me\nBut now I'm a man, I understand what's really wealthy\nIt's not about how much tuition you got in your bank\nBut it's bout how much ammunition that I got in my tank\nYeah, yeah, now y'all scarred 'cause I'm talkin' revolution\nWhat ya rather see me dead by a fuckin' execution\nIf y'all probably go to bed, 'cause it's less confusion\nAll your see in yo head, is my electricution\nBut I'm comin' back, and this time I'm strapped\nAnd fuck +The Law+, 'cause I'm bustin' my gat\nAnd I'm wanted by y'all, and my niggas know that\n'Cause once they fire, my niggas shoot back\nAnd straight up on some real shit, I'm a lyrical jewel\nAsk a wall in the air, and pay ya spiritual dues\nFuck the B.A.'s, 'cause nigga suck a dick\nAnd all ya rabbling backstab, I'm not fuckin' wit\nAiyo fuck poppi' collars, I'd rather cock the revolver\nAnd have ya momma cryin, while ya sister's watchin them dollars\nI'm one of the best, next to 'Face and Jay, Nas, 'Pac and Poppa\nYou can say Priest or Masada, fasada, motherfucker, +Blackball Me+\n\n(Chorus: Killah Priest)\n+Blackball Me+, ya just +Blackball Me+\n+Blackball Me+, motherfucker, +Blackball Me+\n\n(Killah Priest)\nSo, fuck those critics, I ain't got no religious\nWhat ya thought, ya act suspicious, but ya get it\nSo chill wit it, plus nothin' of y'all, ever been in my shoes\nYa probably, play wit a doll, when I payin' my dues\nThat's the type of shit that darkens my heart\nWhere was y'all motherfuckers when Marcus got shot?\nWhere was y'all when the guns sparked up my block?\nWhere was y'all when my sister, was coppin those rocks?\nWhere was y'all when Pooh fell in my arms?\nI had to drag him out the buildin, when them niggas was gone\nWhere was y'all when that nigga, put a gun to my chest?\nPulled the trigger, but no fuckin' bullets was left\nWhat ya figure, that my life was filled wit happiness\nYa wrong, I tell you for real and not the fake stories\nYa can get mad and +Blackball Me+, motherfucker\n\n(Outro: Killah Priest)\n+Blackball Me+ (5X)\n+Blackball Me+ niggas, +Blackball Me+\nYa know ya bad motherfuckers, +Blackball Me+, +Blackball

end I'mma see you redemption\nBelieve that, why tell the truth to Allah...\n+Blackball Me+ motherfuckers...\n\n(Movie Sample)\nMany people feel haunted\nBy what they call evidence of evil forces in the world\nThey see genocide, senseless violence, plagues\nAnd they blame demons, or the Devil himself\nThey believe that demonic spirits can actually possess a human body\nAnd that only rituals of exorcism\nCan lift the possessed from the darkest regions of the unexplained\n\n", "album": {"title": "Priesthood_(2001)&&2484", "genre": "Hip Hop", "year": 2001}}, {"title": "Breathe", "href":

in the midst of the night\nA state of nothingness, a shear bliss descended from heights\nFrom gases, I'm drifting to a liquid to ice\nBecoming frozen, the one who was chosen for life\nIt was I, just a spirit transended from Ja\nThe 7 heavens, the sixth plain, they switching my brain\nI'm like \"Damn, I'm being transformed to man from angel\"\nI thought it'd be painful, then he reached down his hands\nForming the sands, \"Let us make man and stand until the land\nLet's make him dynamic after our likeness\nMaking him psychic, seeing it was right with our conscience\nIn our own image, but let's give him limits\nThus his needs for seeds and his womens\nAnd I will plant his emblem to bring him back in remembrance\nIn time to come, for he was told 'I am the one, I am the

instant, became an infant, I will fall in this place\nCalled Earth, made of plant, rock, water, and dirt\nAnd a name that I forgot, was called Walter at first\nThey cut my umbilical cord, a toddler\nI learned how to scribble on floors, I got older\nAnd learned how to dribble a ball\nUntil the controller opened up my spiritual door\nMy brain novas and out my mouth, the lyrics will pour\nI was born with a seven on my chest, y'all decipher the rest\nIt's just begun, because y'all will know soon\nI am the one, behold, I am the one\n\n(Chorus: Killah Priest (George Clinton))\n(Tight as the snug of

acted nigger-ish, tasted hell bitterness\nSwallow my tongue, like a liquorice\nThough, runnin' through his naked wilderness\nMad as a jackal, with the dry mouth\nThat prowls the grave at the time of drought\nBury me near King David\nSomewhere in the oasis\nFill my body with Godly fragrance\nMay I sleep with the ancient\nFeed my flesh to the ravens\nWish death on every peagan\nIf I finish my night in some gutter with my throat cut\nBy some fake friends who had me doped up\nFill this whole planet with smoke and such\nIf I'm murdered like Abrah'\nMay I fall in the arms of an angel\nFuck a close friend, they can change too\nReturn to the earth as Gairule, hostin my own funeral\nLookin' unusual, may the earth choke and spit up my coffin\nUse my body as an offering, God bless my offsprings\n(Show him the way)\nIf I die tonight\n(Show him the way)\n\n", "album": {"title": "View_From_Masada_(2000)&&4667", "genre": "Hip Hop", "year": 2000}}, {"title": "Bop Your Head", "href":
