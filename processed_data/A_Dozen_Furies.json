There's no, escape from what you've done, to us!\nOr my dreams of molar in false or will I encounter you once more!\n\nTo say that my prayers won't be answered\nIf they arise from deep inside of hatred\nTo say that the guilt is unbearable and undying\nSo save the satisfaction of revenge will fill no void\nMeans you know nothing of me. Means you know nothing of me.\n\nWhere ever you may sleep, just know, that I will not forget\nAs my dream unravavels your brain (your brain)\nYou'll see I'm tourtured this way!\n\nTo say that my prayers won't be answered\nIf they arise from deep inside of hatred\nTo say that the guilt is unbearable and undying\nSo save the satisfaction of revenge will fill no void\nMeans you know nothing of me. Means you know nothing of me.\n\nThis everlasting hatred of you is all I needed to carry on...\nThis everlasting hatred of you is all I needed to carry on!\n\nYou planted the seed, inside her head\nTo cultivate and watch it grow into a monster!\nYou're out of control! (Control) I can't let this go!\nYou're out of control! (Control) I can't let you go!\n\n", "album": {"title": "A_Concept_From_Fire_(2005)&&4538", "genre": "Metalcore", "year": 2005}}]
