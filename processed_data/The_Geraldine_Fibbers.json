question phone\nI see the gliders as they pass me by\nIn the mapless sky\n\nThings are getting stupid in my little cage\nSeems me and my fellow man weren't written on the same page\nAnd the last thing I checked, this old boat was gettin' hot\nBut my boyfriend was not\n\nLost somewhere between the earth and my home\nLost somewhere between the earth and my home\nLost somewhere between the earth and my home\nLost somewhere between the earth and my home\n\nI got an angry eye\nOn your white throat\nI wonder why\nYou're in my boat\nI gave you milk\nI gave you bread\nNow please get out\nOf my flying head\nI tried to talk to you\nI tried to talk to you\nI tried to talk to you\nBut now it's too late, too late, too late, too late\n\nYou thought you saw me in a dream\nInside a jumped-up contraption of rocket parts\nI was zooming away at an alarming rate\nIn a bunch of nuts and bolts that looked like a toaster\nYou called out to me, but I couldn't hear you\nI covered my eyes from the blinding light\nAs I disappeared behind the clouds,\nYou thought you saw my head explode\nYou're not dreaming\nYou're not dreaming\n\nLost somewhere between the earth and my home\nLost somewhere between the earth and my home\nLost somewhere between the earth and my home\nLost somewhere between the earth and my home\n\n", "album": {"title": "Lost_Somewhere_Between_The_Earth_And_My_Home_(1995)&&7566",

me\nDon't try to pull me out, my marmalade\nMarmalade, marmalade\nMake me so happy\nMake me forget my name, my marmalade\n\nDuck pond memories\nPass me by\nPaddleboats and cherry pie\nWet eyelashes\nLook inside\nDroplets gather in your eye\n\nDays and hours melt away\nDolly says \"I'm here to stay\"\nIt's hard to care\nThe mist comes down\n\nMarmalade, marmalade\nTell me a story\nHelp me forget I'm gone, my marmalade\nMarmalade, marmalade\nHide me somewhere,\nCarry me out of here, my marmalade\n\nMarmalade, marmalade\nYou're the devil\nYou're half empty now, my marmalade\nMy

burn your pretty fingers\nGet off of that trip\nYou'll soil your cherry hands\nGet off of that trip\nSeven thousand holes to blow through\n\nOh, scissors and paper\nAnd other sharp things\nYou can chew on that\nFor a while\nYou're a trained dog, girl,\nYou got house, heart of gold\nWon't you try to forget,\nWon't you let me, \nWon't you let me go to sleep\nClose your eyes, pull the plug\nTurn it down, kill the lights\nShut it up, shut it up\nLet your head go under, let your head go under\nLet your head go to nothing, girl\n\nGet off of that trip\nDon't touch it baby\nGet off of that trip\nYou'll burn your pretty fingers\nGet off of that trip\nYou'll soil your cherry hands\nGet off of that trip\nSeven thousand holes to blow through\n\nThere are songbirds\nAnd sweet things\nWhere angels bare wings\nAnd bask in the afterglow\nOf good deeds done by tender souls\nBut I, in my wretched state,\nFat from years of sucking hate,\nCan never scrape the dirt off,\nCan never shake the other side\nIt hides in holes behind my eyes\n\n", "album": {"title": "Lost_Somewhere_Between_The_Earth_And_My_Home_(1995)&&7566", "genre": "", "year": 1995}}, {"title": "A Song About Walls", "href":

breasts\nAnd poor baby can't cry.\n\nShe loved her junky boyfriend,\nTried to make his heart mend\nAsshole with an appetite\nLiving under an elevator shaft can be cold at night,\nCan be cold at night.\n\nWhenever they were hungry,\nShe would get the money\nGirlie couldn't take a stand, till she said\n\"I let you believe you could rule over me\nSo you'd feel like a big strong man.\"\n\nTouched by any feeler, any stinkin' dealer\nShe knew that she would surely die,\nSo she said, \"If I'm gonna die\nWith a needle in my eye,\nI'm gonna do it by my own hand,\nYeah, I'm gonna do it by my own hand.\"\n\nAnd he heard it through the walls (3x)\n\nShe worked like a doctor,\nVery determined\nNot afraid of gettin' pricked by some lame spike\nNever wondering why\n\nAnd he heard it through the walls (3x)\n\nShe left him in the dust\nAnd got even more fucked up\nAnd she did it all by herself\nBut even when she got her ass off of the streets,\nHe would visit her in her dreams\n\nThe last time she saw her darling\nWas at the funeral parlor\nHe was fresh off of the prison shelf\nYeah, he died with a needle in his eye\nBut she was clean, clean, clean\nYeah, she was clean, clean, clean\n\nAnd he heard it through the walls (3x)\n\nOnce there was a girlie,\nShe was kinda surly\nStuck a needle in her eye\n\n", "album": {"title":
