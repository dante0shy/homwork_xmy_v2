leaves \nIt's all I ever claimed to do \nA ploughman I'll never grow into \n\nMy arms miss you \nMy hands miss you \nThe stars sing, I've got their song in my head \n\nBlue in the broad light of day \nYour claws are snagged on my face \nSay it, I wish we would make it \nAnd I wish that I could take it \nWhen you turn on me \n\nMy arms miss you \nMy hands miss you \nThe stars sing, I've got their song in my head \nOh, I don't want my words twisted \nI don't want you to listen too closely\nOr wait for me impatiently \nAnd I hope I can keep seeing you \nAs long as you don't say you're falling in love \n\nCrave translates into slave \nNo one can harness the rain \nAnd I can make myself into rain \nYou feel me on your cheek \nAnd on your sleeve \n\nMy arms miss you \nMy hands miss you \nThe stars sing, I've got their song in my head \nOh, I don't want my words twisted \nI don't want you to listen too closely\nOr wait for me impatiently \nAnd I hope I can keep seeing you \nAs long as you don't say you're falling in love \n\nAnd I can feel you're about to forget \nYes, I can feel you're about to forget\n\n", "album": {"title": "Ultimatum_(2005)&&2596", "genre": "Indie Rock", "year":
