"(Apathy)\nI'll make you motherfuckers break out like soda and grease\nDevoted to speech and how it flows over the beats\nWe're rollin' deep holdin' heat like the code of the streets\nReloadin' my piece while faggot rappers go to police\nYo I use more force than even Yoda can teach\nTry to counter my opponents but the total decreased\nFlows released until every last foe is deceased\nBuild a throne from the bones of the bogus and weak\nSo if you ever pickup a mic to beef or to diss\nYou'll cease to exist before the metal reaches your lips\nThe reason is this: picture gettin' Jesus to spit\nMultiply by six and you'll get me when I flip\nWalk exotic beaches with bitches who fiend for the dick\nThey get exotic, freaky, and viscous, and eager to lick\nLet my foes roll deep, bring toast to the beef\nFuck bullets, I could catch lightening bolts in my teeth\nIt's Apathy, the baddest rapper with the mentality\nThat's as savage as survivors of a nuclear disaster\nAftermath's as massive as asteroid crashes\nFrontin' like your bad when half your boys passive\nI pass that six-way shit, play slick\nI'll be up inside your nose on some switchblade shit\nWriting (?) style motherfuckers better be listening\nI start spittin' and leave your brain like Jessica Simpson\nFresh in the flesh, now-a-days I'm better at pimpin'\nGettin' every single chicken, tryin' every single position\nI'm top seated\nBurn your stomach lining like there's crack rocks in your pocket and\nYou see the cops heated\nCannot be defeated\nIt's not an option I treat it like it's pussy, get it poppin' anytime\nThat I need it\nIf a bitch ain't wifey and she like me or I beat it\nThen she's likely to describe me as being slightly conceited\nThe type to type your number in my phone and then delete it\nLeave it alone, if you ain't givin' me dome then I don't need it\nI got kinky hoes in skimpy clothes\nWith brain powers that could crack Da Vinci codes\n\n", "album": {"title":
