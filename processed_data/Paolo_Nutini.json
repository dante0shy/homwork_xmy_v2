the high-street madness\nI fight with my brain to believe my eyes\nAnd it's harder than you think\nTo believe this sadness that creeps up my spine \nAnd haunts me through the night\nLife is good, and the girls are gorgeous\nSuddenly the air smells much greener now \nAnd I'm wandering around with a half pack of cigarettes\nSearching for the change that I've lost somehow\n\nThese streets have too many names for me\nI'm used to Glenfield Road and spending my time down in Orchy\nI'll get used to this eventually\nI know, I know\n\nWhere'd the days go when all we did was play?\nAnd the stress that we were under wasn't stress at all\nJust a run and a jump into a harmless fall\nFrom walking by a high-rise to a landmark square\nYou see millions of people with millions of cares\nAnd I struggle to the train to make my way home\nI look at the people as they sit there alone\nLife is good, and the sun is shining\nEverybody floats to their ideal place\nAnd the children all smile as a boat shuffled by them\nTrying to pretend that they've got some space\n\nThese streets have too many names for me\nI'm used to Glenfield Road and spending my time down in Orchy\nI'll get used to this eventually\nI
