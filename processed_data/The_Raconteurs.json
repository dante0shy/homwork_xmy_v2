remain\nAnd those who would enslave me to get to me\nMust get past you and will have no luck\n'Cause you'll protect me from all pain\n\nIt's true, you know what\n\nYou're the most beautiful\nYeah, the most beautiful thing\n'Cause anything else can't compare\nIt must be the blood that's running through your blue veins\n\nYour blue veins\n\nYour blue veins\n\nAnd I know you won't deceive me like the
