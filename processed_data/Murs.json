claim gangsta rap's the CNN of the streets\nBut it's used as an excuse to pretend over beats\nSo I'ma lend my speech to all within my reach\nTo tell what really goes on from cells to the streets\nNow in LA as you know there's a war going on\nAnd it's been going on since before I was born\nThough the undisputed origin has yet to be formed\nIt all used to boil down to the red and the blue\nBut that got fucked up as the many led the few\nNow there's bloods killin' bloods and crips killin' crips\nThat's niggas killin' niggas they play kickball with\nIt ain't as simple as it was way back in '86\nLet me give an example of some ol' MURS shit\nMy sect of mid-city is livin' on the edge\n'Cause there's four gangs at war and none of them wear red\nAny new car or face could mean bloodshed\nWhich led to the other night, I'm in my girl's Bug, right\nI'm bout to hit the block to see who's chillin' on the spot outside\nWhen I put it in park, the homey got a SK aimed at my ride\nSo I step out slowly, 'body no one fear\nHe yells, that's Murs I see his beard from here\nBut I told this whole story just to make things clear\nSo it don't seem weird when I tell ya this here\n\nLast night I almost got shot on my block\nNot the block where I live at, the block where I chill at\nWhere I keep it real at, and used to pack steel\nAt times I feel it's the spot I'll get killed at\n\nNow in the entertainment industry they have sweeps weeks\nBut it's Thursday in my hood when they sweep them streets\nA whole fleet of the task that they simply call CRASH\nThat's Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums\nIf anyone should ask what the acronym reflects\nPut into effect to try to keep the gangs in check\nNow they're just another gang out bangin' they set\nKnown for stirring up some shit when your hood is at peace\nThe only pig I know dying to create beef\nBut let me get on with my story so that all of y'all can peep\nOnce again I'm on my block right, known as Cloverdale\nPlayin' 2K2 while I'm talkin' on my cell well\nWhile I'm inside eyes glued to the screen\nCRASH rolls on my homies with the Thursday routine\nWhat's your name, where you goin', where you been, where you from\nWe say the same thing while they just play dumb\nWe don't gang-bang we got J-O-B's\nStill they make 'em turn around and get down on they knees\nMe, I'm screamin' in the house I just won by three\nSo when I run out on the porch to tell the homies come and see\nI see 'em on the ground and I'm like, god damn\nPlus I got this black Nextel phone in my hand\nThey both yell freeze, guns aimed at me\nAnd even though I drop my phone it's plain to see\n\nIt was a 2 month tour that ended in Japan\nSo the first day back I had to spend it with my fam\nThat night I was goin' down to holler at my folks\nHave a few beers, smoke, and share a few jokes so\nTo the block I bail but when I got to the dale\nEverybody's on the porch lookin' distraught as hell\nThey start to tell me on how some fools from the other side\nJust tried to kill T, he don't fuck with nobody\nJust be mindin' his biz\nSo you have to understand what an explosive situation this Terry thing is\nMy nigga never gang-banged a day in his life so\nFuckin' with him is not a way to earn stripes\nBut a way to get wiped off the motherfuckin' planet\nI don't claim to be a killer with a heart made of granite\nBut try to kill my best friend and it's on goddammit\nI had the big homey roll me over to my place\nSo I could pick up this nine I kept just in case\nOf some shit like this, a box of hollow-tips\nI slipped back to the block with the heat in my hand\nWe sat up in the house loadin' guns, makin' plans\nThey asked me was it stolen, and why I never told 'em\nNobody in the hood ever knew that I was holdin'\nI told 'em I forgot but I did it on purpose\nSo they wouldn't ask to borrow it to go and do dirt with\nNow we locked and loaded and about to hit the streets\nWhen we look to the corner there's a Jeep tryin' to creep\nWith its headlights off, we all leap for cover\nThey start to let off - now how does this sound?\nWhen I hit the deck, my pistol hits the ground\nSo the homey picked it up and let off a couple rounds\nAfter that went down I knew I might get clowned\nSo I shook to the crib to take a shower and lay down\nThe next morning woke up, rolled out of bed\nI called my girl up and this is what I said\n\n", "album": {"title": "....The_End_Of_The_Beginning_(2003)&&6341", "genre": "Hip Hop", "year": 2003}}, {"title": "Yesterday & Today", "href":

understood\nWhy she really came around, when my dough wasn't good\nNow you could call it puppy love 'cause I got dogged out\nNow on all my note books I got her name crossed out\nBut she lost out, I just lost profit, when she left me in cold\nHeart broke like like my pockets and...\n\n(Murs)\nYou know them days you just got the blues\nAll stressed and depressed from just watchin the news\nNo matter what good you do it seems you always get screwed\nGot you caught up in your feelings now you off in the mood\nShake that attitude and do what you can\nSet a couple goals follow through with your plans\nTime waits for no man and tomorrows not promised\nSo if she's still alive shoot a call to your momma\nCause the fighting and the drama, its just not worth it\nNobodys perfect, ain't none of us worthless\nWe all got a place, and we all got a purpose\nNow I'm not taking y'all to Sunday service\nBut ya clap your hands as you stand up and work it\nLike your grandmama used to do that fan

in a movie but I made my own instead\nStill pioneering with this independent hustle\nAnd your mic cord is much too short for you to tussle\nFor the man that pro like 40-Water, poured in remembrance\nOf every hood soldier that died in ghetto tenements\nInnocent till proven guilty\nShould I die don't look for the dude that killed me\nLook for a brighter tomorrow, and in spite of the sorrow\nLive every moment to the fullest so your life isn't hollow\nAnd you can holla out my name from the top of the game\nAnd since you passed homey I promise I'll do the same\nFor if a soul is

much\nTried to lead by example, didn't I have some nerve\nTelling you stay out the street while I was out slanging herb\nBut I always preferred you do it smarter then me\nYou didn't have to prove nothing being harder then me\nYou helped mom at the cleaners\nStayed away from misdemeanors\nI was proud of you then\nPlease believe I still am\nDon't let the world get you down, throw you off your program\nLife is hard, even harder on a young black man\nIf it gets rough blow a blunt and bump some more slow jams\nKnow every man with a badge is probably a punk\nBut don't ever risk your freedom,

on his shirt\nAnd never been to a funeral\nNow am I out of touch, if I say it's unusual\nThis dude will sing a love ballad to his homeboys, before a young lady\nNow ain't that crazy\nIf you didn't love that bitch then why you make her keep your baby\nOoh abortions not right\nBut just the other night\nYou were a killer pull a trigger before you have a fare fight\nBut if you value one, then why not value every life\nIts obvious you know the difference between wrong and right\nIt's not about being self, its hard to follow the light\nWhen you're surrounded by darkness, almost drowning in

life is in the breeze\nMakin' my knees squeak beggin' my soul to please speak\nUniversal guides then listen, trouble sometimes blister my vision\nBut I've enlisted my mind for the full mission\nNot bullshittin' on a stoop with a stool pigeon\nTalkin' about \"What'chu gonna do in the future?\"\n\"Movin' up the ladder with ass kissin'.\"\nI'm on my last mission in life\nDumping through the middle grounds like a junkyard dog in a prowl\nGuarding my bow throwin' in the towel when it's right\nUntil then I'm walking towards the light with my sword drawn from a fight\nDoing everything bad that happens has an opposite reaction\nKeep my feet on traction, until my goals in life are right in front of my face\nAnd I can smell, touch and taste what I've been workin' for\nI'll be walkin' out the front door\n\nIt's a done deal, do it till it's done\n'Cause the movement don't stop till the rising sun\nIt's a done deal, let's have a little fun\n'Cause the movement don't stop till the rising sun\n\n(MURS)\nI'm talking done deal, closed case\nAin't no time for looking back on the road you take\nYou gotta claim your spot, nobody hold your place\nAin't no time to preach about time you chose to waste\nYou gotta mold your fate, hold your weight\nAll my peoples NY to the Golden Gate\nWho know the rap about the breed and the gold is fake\nHow we all supposed to eat when they want the whole cake?\nNiggas want all the dough, but never learn to bake\nSo they rise too fast and they burn the plate\nBut I'm concerned with fate, and watch the turns I take\nKnow this world is affected by the moves you make\nSo I ain't gotta stop moving just to prove you fake\nJust spit these real raps to get this real estate\nSo I can steal your fanbase and steal your date\nWon't have a soul mate until I meet my soul mate\n\n(Scarub)\nIt's like I'm type of walking towards heaven through hell\nEveryday it's something new, I'll make it through; so many fell off\nWhoever knew it cost so much to clutch a dream\nIn between the thumb and the index lies a small space for mistakes\nThe indication for almost\nSometimes you hold it until you face to magnify how\nClose you came in life to something\nThat you measure up to\nI know that pain like my enemy\nSlap my ass when I'm born, and will hold my hand when it's the end of me\nThe lessons learned in between these two extremes feed me energy\nI keep it moving with the force of a crane\nWhere the steel ball's just swinging at the end\nAll it takes is one pen to tap these words out like\nMorse code over your eardrums\nTo speak to your spirit\nIntoxicate you with my speech to crash crew like drunk driving\nWhether it be freestyling or stage diving I float over these weak rappers\nLike volcanic islands, I got a fire in me\n\n",

earrings, crunch time, punch time\nBelieve me I know, let me tell you 'bout this one time\nI came home late, didn't call - wait that's not the point\nShe gets another fight she's goin' back to the joint\nSo, don't waste her time we both know you can't fight\nNow quit hidin in them bushes and go home - goodnight!\n\n(Verse Three)\nYo, I knew this silly chick was diggin me\nI shoulda had a girl, but if you keep it on the low then you can get with me\nSee I done switched the game up, now she ask when I'ma leave her\nYou know the answer last time that came up\nWhy you keep stressin, just keep undressin\nThis a headache I swear I never learned my lesson\nTold myself about these undercover dealings - why?\nCause these silly chicks end up always catchin feelings\nAnd what I'm 'sposed to do\nWhen a late night freak in the Jeep end up gettin' a lil' close to you\nClose to who - close to me?\nNah my lil' thing on the side, this ain't how it's supposed to be\nSupposed to hit it, quit it, hit it again\nChill for a while then flip it again\nBut she started actin' crazy, I split to the end\nShe told the girls how I get down, now I'm hittin her friend, ha ha\n\n", "album": {"title":

bed, hungover, none sober\nLike the Joe's rushed my body and I was the sole cobra\nStill a soldier grabbed a soda helped my stomach settle down\nThen fell into the shower as to let the funk drown\nPut Degree under my arms, turned off the alarm\nYou only set it to regret it\nA million things to do but work is where I'm headed\nThe dreaded grindstone on the edge of my bed\nI sit and let my mind zone on how fun last night was\nStarted with a light buzz that slowly progressed into a full blown fade\nI was trying to get laid, but, got no action\nIt was back to the crib for personal satisfaction\nTriple X, DVD's, I got a whole stack in\nWas snapped out of my daydream by something that I seen\nI left the tissue full of spunk on the floor by my jeans\nIt seems I have 15 minutes to make the 20 minute ride it takes to get to work\nSo I fly out the door while I'm putting on my shirt\nStart the car and then I'm off to get in trouble with my boss\nHe runs his mouth like a bitch sometimes I wish he'd lay me off\nSo that I could lay him out with one little punch right to his fat ass mouth\nBut now I'm assed out, 'cause these fools on the freeway\nBe driving like they ain't got nowhere to go\nYou know those fucks in the fastlane moving hella slow\nGot me yelling at my windshield\nNow it's like 10 till I want to call in\nMan I think it everyday but I'm not ballin'\nSo I got to go get paid and continue the charade of\nCustomer service since I don't get commission\nMy efforts seem worthless thanks and have a nice day\n'Cause what I got to say even if they were rude\nAnd gave me attitude it's a shame what I have to do to get written fool\n\nI work hard\nGoddamn hard\nTo keep this roof over my head\nAnd pay off these credit cards\nI work hard\nGoddamn hard\nSo I could pay off all my debt\nAnd get a house with a yard\nI work hard\nGoddamn hard\nTo put that gas off in the tank\nAnd make the payments on this car\nI work hard\nGoddamn hard\nSo I could wild out every weekend\nAnd buy drinks at the bar\n\nTry being on the road for 45 days straight\nRoad manager's the driver and myself plus 8\nOther motherfuckers and their idio-sympatic\n'Sop brought two-systems he's a video fanatic\nSunspot got enough weed to give me contact for the month and a half\nPSC got the gas and forever blowing up the spot with his rotten ass\nOf course Grouch brought a task that'll fill his time plot\nTrying to hook Pro-Tools to his new laptop\nEligh's on the last cot a hypocondriac\nSo with him you never know if it's a fever or an act\nScarub's usually either reading, writing, or sleeping\nAnd Bicasso needs to use somebodies celly's on the creeping\nMe I'm simply dreaming plotting schemes to get some money\nAlmost forgot about Arata but you know\nAs we tour throughout the country everybody starts to argue over what we\nWatch on TV and who drank the last brew, who's been hating on who\nMaybe throw a punch or two until a virus breaks out\nAnd how healthy can you be?\nWhen you getting little sleep and all you eat is take out\nBut the show must go on when you live in dusk till dawn\nIf I don't rap every night, I might lose a fan\nSo even if I got the flu I got a mic in my hand\nAnd I haven't even spoke on the one night stands\nYeah that might sound fly to the average guy\nBut when you got a girl at home you got to let it pass you by\nSo I try to play the sidelines\nWatch what they pull, but on a bus full of women, hard to stay faithful\nSo I cheat not because I hate my girl because I miss her\nEventhough she won't believe me when I say I only kissed her\nBeen home a couple days and she still won't speak\nStill I got to hit the road again\nBegin another week\n\nI work hard\nGoddamn hard\nTo keep this roof over my head\nAnd pay off these credit cards\nI work hard\nGoddamn hard\nSo I could pay off all my debt\nAnd get a house with a yard\nI work hard\nGoddamn hard\nTo put that gas off in the tank\nAnd make the payments on this car\nI work hard\nGoddamn hard!\n\n", "album": {"title": "....The_End_Of_The_Beginning_(2003)&&6341", "genre": "Hip Hop", "year": 2003}}, {"title": "Please Leave", "href": "Please_Leave&&3197", "artist":
