anymore\nThat's the last thing she said to you\nAnd now when you call she don't answer anymore\nOr the line is busy and you can't get through\n\nAnd the time it will take you to learn from your mistake\nAnd the time it will take to dial the phone\nAnd the time it will take you to realize her greatness, she'll be gone, she's moved on\nTo someone who takes the time\n\nHer love wasn't her priority to you\nYou had other things on your mind\nAnd now that it's much to little and too far too late\nThe busy signals all that's left behind\nYou're all alone\n\nAnd the time it will take you to learn from your mistake\nAnd the time it will take to dial the phone\nAnd the time it will take you to realize her greatness, she'll be gone, she's moved on\nTo someone who takes the time\n\nHey no one knows what they have until they don't\nAnd by then it doesn't matter anymore\nYou're all alone\n\nAnd the time it will take you to learn from your mistake\nAnd the time it will take to dial the phone\nAnd the time it would take you to realize her greatness, she'll be gone (she'll be gone)\nAnd the time it will take you to realize her greatness, she'll be gone, she's moved on\nHang up the
