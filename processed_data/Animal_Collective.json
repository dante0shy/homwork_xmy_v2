home?\nThere's something starting, don't know why\n\nAnd in a house so cozy\nFew words are spoken\nLet's take our shoes off and unwind\nWhen there's minuets off in the background drowning out\nEyes off, ears off, test the kiss good night\nA kiss good night\nDon't keep my loving on my mind\n\nBecause it's messy, yes, this mess is mine\nThough mine is messy, yours is maybe nine\n\nLook we've had similar stitches\nLook we have similar frowns\nDo the elderly couples still kiss and hug and\nGrab their big wrinkly skin, so tough, wrinkly wrink, wrink wrinkly rough?\n\nDid you see the words you know?\nGive me rabies, hand me babies at the hospital\nViolent ends with friends that go\nI kissed a few in sticky shoes, our cartoon show is broken\nDid you see the words you know?\nGive me rabies,

like you anymore\nWell I found new feelings at the feeling store\nAnd I can't find you at our kissing place\nWell I'm scared of those new pair of eyes you have,\" so \n\nI duck out, go down to find
