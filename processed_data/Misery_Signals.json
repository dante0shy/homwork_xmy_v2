What wasted time. \nI always hoped somehow it'd never happen to us. \nBut it is something that did and something I can't forget. \nAnd after all of our times, you fucking did what you did. \nThis was days and weeks, days and weeks of deceit, it was days and weeks of deceit. \nYou turned and walked away. You say you'd be back tomorrow. Well tomorrow has come and gone. \nLooks like you're choking on all those lies, they did catch up to you this time. \nI swear I heard you say, \"blood is forever\". \nWell it seems \"forever\" meant nothing. To you, it meant nothing. \"Forever\" meant nothing.
