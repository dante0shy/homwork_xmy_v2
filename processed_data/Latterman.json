to\nAnd TV told you to\nAnd even your own friends told you to\nAnd on and on and on\nComing to you from kids who fuck up\nOppressive thinking lives inside you and me\nIndoctrinated\nWe always fuck up\nWe have to challenge who we were taught to be\nSo please don't talk to me\nSitting so high up in your tree\nCause there's bullshit in my backyard I can already see\n\n", "album": {"title":

circles in and out of this place\nMay this headache go away\nMay this smile stay the same\nWhen I grow up\nI want to be like me\nAnd when you grow up I hope that you're still like you\nWe're still living under the same sky\nBut these parking lot lights block mine\nAnd we'd like to think that we've changed\nBut I keep telling the same ten stories in and out of this place\nWith the same embellished lies about the best times of our lives\nAnd these stories they go on and on\n\n", "album": {"title": "No_Matter_Where_We_Go_(2005)&&1390", "genre": "", "year": 2005}}, {"title": "We Work

footsteps\nThe ceiling is wearing thin and any day it could all give in\nIdeas based on cracked foundations\nWe hoped it wouldn't fall apart\nBut it's falling apart\nIt's fallen apart\nWake me up and get me from this place\nThe devil seems happy to smile at me\nI'll play the part the best I can but move on and leave him to his work at hand\nIf you can set the pace I can use the change\nLet me know when you want to go\nI'm letting go of these empty spaces and hopeless faces\nWe're worth more then this\nWe're worth so much more then this\nWake me up anytime you can\n\n", "album": {"title":

sleepers.\nBut I don't have the answers.\nBut I know another lonely night on this couch\nWon't do anything for my world or myself.\n\nSo next time I hear someone call someone a fag\nOr a guy call a girl a bitch\nI'm going to fucking scream.\nYeah next time the passion hits me\nI'll try to find out\nWhat the pop songs mean.\n\nExpressing my guilt through a consumer product\nDoesn't mean I've solved anything.\nBut as I've always found a way through my pain\nI'll find a way through my apathy.\nThe revolution in video games\nDistracts me from the real thing\nAnd from where I need to be - in

this time around but just like us it will find it's place so let's just give it some time for now\nI don't always have all the right words\nWe don't always have all the right words\nLose ourselves in the fire we have lit\nDon't worry I won't get burned by it\nSend another expression to take with me wherever I choose to go\nLets take a moment to throw our cautions to the wind\nLet's see you and me
