me a straight answer\n\nIf you still want me, please forgive me\nThe crown of love has fallen from me\nIf you still want me please forgive me\nBecause your hands are not upon me\n\nI shrugged them off

me, please forgive me\nThe crown of love is not upon me\nIf you still want me, please forgive me\n'Cause the spark is not within me\nIt's not within me, it's not within me\nYou gotta be the one, you

tried to name our babies but we forgot all the names that, the names we used to know\nBut sometimes we remember our bedrooms and our parents' bedrooms and the bedrooms of our friends\nThen we think of our parents, well, whatever happened to them?\n\nYou change all the lead sleeping in my head to gold\nAs the day grows dim I hear you sing a golden hymn\nThe song I've been trying to sing\nPurify the
