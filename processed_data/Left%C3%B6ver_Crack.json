remember: there's no winner in this fucked-up human race\nI know you might be searching for some meaning on this Earth\nBut don't be stabbing nature in the back by giving into birth\n\nAnd you're too ugly, and I'm too fat\nWhat kind of seed are we to spawn with genetic cards like that?\nAddiction and depression are just swimming in my cum\nAnd we're all weak and dumb\n\nWe're mostly runts and too high-strung\nIn nature, Mother eats the young\nWho are we to breed?\nPut away your seed\nWe can't evolve an iron lung\n\nToo many people on the way\nOur world gets smaller every day\nAs quantity grows, life quality goes\nOur lives are sick and in decay\n\n", "album": {"title": "Fuck_World_Trade_(2004)&&4270", "genre": "Crack Rock Steady", "year": 2004}}, {"title": "Via Sin Dios", "href":

poisonous pollution and the pointlessness of care\nAnd in a blink, we blow away to dust upon the air\n\nSix feet down and underground\n\nA clotted, cold perfection still in petrifaction lay\nWe'll run and rot to crumble in a petrified decay\n\nAnd inasmuch as I can see no future, why go on\nSo this here I present to you one final poem in song\nAnd I can see a darkness and a clearing of the path\nIn the overpopulation, I can simplify the math\n\nSix feet down and underground\n\nA clotted, cold perfection still in petrifaction lay\nWe'll run and rot to crumble in a petrified decay\nThe hazy warmth encompasses my eyes a misty sea\nThe soft embrace of sunset in a dark eternity\n\nPrayer and flowers mock and tease my terrorized beliefs\nThe truth is that we're born to die until our sweet release\nI care so much and not at all about every living breath\nThe sadness of this sentience; a sentence to my death\n\nIn my grave and down the drain; erase the misspent past\nThe tortured love in memories are never meant to last\n\n", "album": {"title": "Fuck_World_Trade_(2004)&&4270", "genre": "Crack Rock Steady", "year": 2004}}, {"title": "Burn Them Prisons", "href":

products shine in the display\nThe same old song of compromise went platinum today\n\nFrom town to town and state to state\nThe same old song you love to hate\nThe same shit stacked upon your plate\nRotate again and syndicate\nWe've been waiting far too long\nTo change the band, to change the song\nThrough every day and dusk and dawn\nWe've been brainwashed to sing along\nNo difference between the hot new single\nAnd the Pepsi ad's commercial jingle\nThe beauty's withered faded crinkle\nJust sip the coke and pop the pringle\nThe boardroom is the dragon's lair\nThey play us shit 'cause they don't care\nThe clearest channel plays unfair\nAnd we all want you off the air\nOverdose on shoddy culture; mediocre trends\nAuto-Tune the bottom line as a mean to meet the ends\nMerging corporate empires create the ill conglomerations\nAnd buy up to reprogram major market radio stations\n\nFabricate one single voice broadcast from sea to sea\nWhat once held notions of change and choice\nIs now being controlled fully\nDeregulations raised the edge of exploitation's bar\nPolitics replaced by \"bling\" and clothes and fancy cars\nTrapped imaginations from the video's blinding light\nBombarded with monotony that captivates the sight\n\nThe channel we've been tuned to is all frigid, blank and clear\nTold what to eat and drink and buy and whom to hate and fear\nPoisoned by the fairytale, a capitalistic dream\nGo to sleep; you're free and brave, and on the winning team\n\nNo way to die\n\n(Spoken outro)\nWe figured out a long time ago that it's much easier to control people\nWhen we're all watching the same TV shows\nListening to the same radio stations, going to the same movies\nLooking at the same billboards, eating the same food\nAnd speaking the same
