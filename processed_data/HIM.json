time, let me fall into your arms\nIt could be alright, don't let us grow any colder\nFor this one last time, let me close to your heart\n\nEver amazed how bright are the flames we are burning in\nEver smiled of the tragedies we have locked deep inside\nAren't you obsessed by our hand was on the verge of beginning?\nWon't you cherish your fear of life that keeps us alive?\n\nOh, at least you could
