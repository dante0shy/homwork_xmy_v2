west\nAnd my spirit is crying for leaving\nIn my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees\nAnd the voices of those who stand looking\n\nIt makes me wonder\nIt really makes me wonder\n\nAnd it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune\nThen the piper will lead us to reason\nAnd a new day will dawn for those who stand long\nAnd the forests will echo with laughter\n\nIf there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now\nIt's just a spring clean for the May Queen\nYes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run\nThere's still time to change the road you're on\n\nAnd it makes me wonder\n\nYour head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know\nThe piper's calling you to join him\nDear lady can you hear the wind blow, and did you know\nYour stairway lies on the whispering wind, oh\n\nAnd as we wind on down the road\nOur shadow's taller than our soul\nThere walks a lady we all know\nWho shines white light and wants to show\nHow everything still turns to gold\nAnd if you listen very hard\nThe tune will come to you at last\nWhen all are one and one is all, yeah\nTo be a rock and not to roll\n\nAnd she's buying a stairway to Heaven\n\n",
