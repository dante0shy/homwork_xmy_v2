strikers held out for 4 long months\nHard bread and coffee everyday\nBetween the scabs and the guns\nAnd the Pinkertons\nTheir courage was slipping away\nSo the Union called in Mother Jones\nShe said,\"Will you be slaves or be men?\"\nThen she told all the women to meet up at dawn\n\"And we'll go to the lion's den\"\n\nSo the women marched to that Drip Mouth Mine\nWith their dishpans mops and brooms\nAnd the sheriff said, \"Now you go back home\nI'm afraid you'll upset the mules\"\nBut an angry woman knocked the sheriff down\nShe said \"to hell with the mules and with you\"\nThen they chased those scabs all the way back to town\nAnd that strike was almost through\n\nOh Mother cried out shame, shame, shame\nWe've nothing to lose but our chains\nMany a miner's life's been saved\nBy a
