parts\nTo make our lives worthwhile...\n\nWe are the chain of the changes\nWe cannot begin at the end\nTeach me the means\nTo change my future\nTeach to me... and the world\n\nAll the time spent in vain\nWhile the world dives into pain\nWe should bring some hope\nWe should give more love\n\n", "album": {"title": "Execution_(2005)&&8732", "genre": "", "year": 2005}}, {"title": "Absolution",

lie\nOne day you gonna die\nAnd you'll see all your life time\nPassing in front of your eyes\n\nAnd you will recognize\nThat it is not your time anymore\n\n(Tribuzy)\nSo what could I have done?\nI've tried but I couldn't run\nI'll be like this forever\nForever and ever\nI'll burn as the sun\n\nWill the celestial gates\nBe closed for my mistakes?\nI'll live this hell forever\nThis hell never surrenders\nHow could I escape?\n\n(Kiske)\nEveryone one day has the chance\nOf entering the sacred land\n\n(Chorus: Kiske)\nAll of us want absolution\nYou should never give up\nAll of us want absolution\nJust open your soul when you say amen\n\n(Kiske)\nYou must open your heart\nLet the love clean the dark\nYour salvation is all in your hands.\nYou must open your soul\nAnd choose a way to go\nBefore your life reaches the end\n\n(Tribuzy)\nBut I've been a sinner, the worst one that you could have seen\nSo now I know that there's no way out to me\nI was the black sheep son, so what should I receive?\n\n(Kiske)\nYou could reach for God\nForget the past cause it is lost\nAnd now you see how you were unfair\nThis was your first right step\nDon't let this one be the last\nAll your life was a great test\n\n(Tribuzy)\nBut I failed on this and I filled all my life with sins\nI poisoned the earth and destroyed so many people's dreams\nNow I am lying in my bed and you appear saying all these things\nThis should be my last breath and about all my sins...\nI'm sorry... forgive me\n\n(Kiske)\nI'm here to be your helping hands\nHold on to my wings and ride with me trough the sacred land\n\n(Chorus: Kiske)\nAll of us want absolution\nYou should never give up\nAll of us want absolution\nJust open your soul when you say amen\n\n(Chorus: Tribuzy)\nAll of us want absolution\nSo I will never give up\nAll of us want absolution\nI cleansed my soul free from evil\n\n", "album": {"title": "Execution_(2005)&&8732", "genre": "", "year": 2005}}, {"title": "Execution", "href":
