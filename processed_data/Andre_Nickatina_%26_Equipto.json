water, make it look just like a sauna\nSome holla for Madonna, man\nSome holla for their momma\n9 times out of 10 they never knew who shot them\n\nA gangster in a hotub in the midst of drama\nThe bullets hit the water, make it look just like a sauna\nSome holla for Madonna, man\nSome holla for their momma\n9 times out of 10 they never knew who shot them\n\nI let the dice roll, when my life on the roll\nGet paid with the stage with the mic control\nI'm pro and all official, I'll ball witchu\nAll my problems off a thizzle, a small little\nI'm a boo but cool and calm you know that's me\nI tell them Miami thing about to throw that d\nAnd a home philly east until she roll that weed\nBut she can shoot with the breeze it's nothing to quease\nLike a sneeze I'm blessed\nSo you can excuse me, I'm too busy watching hoes poppin' their coochie\nOh yeah I can see why you call me breezy\nMy 'ginese connections got deals on QDs\nThe rookie of the year man, pullin' a flukey\nI feel to do the right thing but I ain't moving\nA man of my action, go ahead and act\nI'm passionate and rappin' with a west coast accent\nMy homies to the point when they speak to women\nAnd we still conversatin' so we keep it pimpin'\nI been breaking rules all my life\nSeventh grade in the back room chocolate type\nI need paper, hey, up in a major way\nI won't cater a player for those that hatin' the game\nI say later don't look at this as doing me a favor\nI made a pact with my home boys to keep it player\n\n\nYo this is the take off, and yo baby this is the bake off\nSirloin beef with the A1 steak sauce\nI got it going on acting like a love jones\nTurn like a cyclone, bust with the lights on\nI hit the scene like Peppy La pui\nI'm in a double vested suit that I copped from Lou\nI'm from the X generation, crime location\nTurn down your invitation to your radio station\nMove like a cobra gone from the rollas\nIt's just like the hunt for the red October\nSome pit-bull terrier from the Ronald Regan era\nAnd me and my players keep it cold as the Sierra\nWe dress like it's GQ magazine and the homies said he gotta keep a magazine\nAnd this freak said she see me in the magazine\nSo we broke down jaw on the magazine\nMy sugar heel and under field with 4 wheels\nAnd driving with my knees so that we don't spill\nI'm going at you gator on your izod sweater\nAnd broke cats say there ain't nothing like cheddar\nThey bomb first and say I'm caught up in the wrong curse\nAnd I never get to kick it with the god flirt\nAnd when I ask why, it was an alibi\nThey took my wings so an angel like me couldn't fly\nAnd I wonder why\n\n", "album": {"title": "Horns_And_Halos_(2005)&&5861", "genre": "Hip Hop", "year": 2005}}, {"title": "Blueberry Rain", "href": "Blueberry_Rain&&1442", "artist":

burn\nI'm never finished, not even after my last words\nNatural disasters might take your boy\nNo doubt just let me go out in a blaze of glory\nHelping kids cross the bridge, it is what it is\nLive life with a whole lot of sacrifice to give\nI don't deserve it\nBelieve me if God told me it's curtains\nI hope I serve my purpose and he knows I wasn't perfect\nYoung Queez in this game for

in the cipher\nMan like seven day though milk man I make 'em all expire\nHands up in the flame man and lust for the game\nAnd even if I'm cripple and I'm walkin' with a cane\nOr sittin' in a chair, it's like Fred Estere\nMan eatin on steak bake at the lions layer\nThink I'm about to fall man I can hear the call\nMan what's the spread if you talkin' bout that football\nLike Nino did the cartah and yeah I said the cartah\nI came up in the game as a San Francisco starter\nMan this is for the father, I spit it like a round\nCuttin' through the make-up just to shake up these clowns\n\n\"Yeah, that's it all right\nBam you can dick it out but you couldn't show you can't take it no more\nYour through, well\"\n\n\"By the wet poisoning there was six bullets\" (*gunshots*)\n\n\"Oh thanks boys for the artillery\"\n\n", "album": {"title": "Horns_And_Halos_(2005)&&5861", "genre": "Hip Hop", "year": 2005}}, {"title": "Upgrade Call", "href": "Upgrade_Call&&5706", "artist": {"unique_name":

tired of beezees sayin' the same stuff\nFumble over words and wonderin why I hang up\nI had to upgrade and do things different\nYa you spoil me with loyalty and true commitment\nBut in this world of pimpin' I could smell the hunger\nDon't be naive to this game take my name and number\nIf you call you call well then you've made a decision\n(\"Hello?\" \"Hello?\")\nAfter all I see you've came to your senses\nCommon let's get together like shoes to feet\nFirst things first fill your purse with a chosen fee\nQueasey I gotta regulate peace set the record straight\nEstimate if the money you make is worth the headache\nCross the golden gate I could send you back\nHit the night track on your break call me right back\nYeah gimmie the news don't let me catch you in another lie\nAnd start trippin' off when you caught him on the other line, bitch.\n\n(Woman singing)\nI'll be done here comes your ghost again\nBut that's not unussual its just that the moon is full\nAnd you happen to call...\n\nSeven seven seven dash nine three eleven\nYou packed up, left and got to steppin\nAnd here go the weather a change you will out weather the game\nAnd keep a cane but I had him in my aim\nI'm gettin' paid\nI French talk in my French braids\nI got the homies with the ladies in the heels on the sharp blade\nYou better buckle up or settle up or settle down\nYo my virizon's on the frits can you hear me now?\nMan I'm a wide receiver actin' like a runninback\nSometimes my concience whispers is the money comin' back\nSometimes I answer back man I'm a quarterback\nAnd when I throw ain't nobody interceptin that\nSo I don't think so man let the freak go\nMan get the game in your brain and get the real doe\nIt's like I'm paintin a piccaso when the phone rings\nEspecially when your baby girl says she's doin' things\n\n(Woman singing)\nHere I sit hand on the telephone\nHearing the voice I know\nA couple of light years ago\nHeading straight for it all...\n\nShe was exotic with a body to get with\nCalling from blocked numbers with the label restrited\nTalkin' all kinda shit tryin' data a rapper\nSaid she escorts comin' on the blade imma catch her\nOn the hunt with a blunt in the home of the mad\nRaisers stalkin pacin' with a phone in my hand\nI'll be waitin still patient as she's making the call\nNow I swear that till I get her till she's breakin me off\nI'm a boss with accepting nothin' less then perfect\nNo I will not answer the phone 'less its worth it\nTricks is the witness the game is the business\nYou learn I don't play you gon pay for my minutes\nRoll the split swishers slowly get the picture\nCuttin' off the calls I'm gonna switch the digits\nBitches, you know you're bound to get it right one day\nThrow it against the wall and upgrade\n\n(Woman singing)\nI'll be done here comes your ghost again\nBut that's not unussual its just that the moon is full\nAnd you happen to call...\n\n", "album": {"title": "Horns_And_Halos_(2005)&&5861", "genre":
