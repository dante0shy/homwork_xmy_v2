talking straightforward to hoes\nGot uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose\nTo cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows\nIn they socks and they soles, niggaz holdin' they rolls\nCorners leave souls opened and closed, hopin' for mo'\nWe know where to go, niggaz rollin' in droves\nThey shoot the wrong way, 'cause they ain't know and they goes\nThe streets ain't safe 'cause they ain't knowing the code\nBy the foes I was told, either focus or fold\nGot cousins with flows, hope they open some doors\nSo we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls\nNow I roll in a Olds, with windows that don't roll\nDown the roads where cars get broken and stole\nThese are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove\nThe world is cold, the block is hot as a stove\nOn the corners\n\n(Kanye West)\nI wish I could give you this feelin'\nI wish I could give this feelin'\nOn the corners niggaz rob or kill\nAnd dyin' just to make a livin', huh?\n\n(Spoken: The Last Poets)\nWe overstated, we underrated, we educated\nThe corner was our time when time stood still and\nGators and snakeskins and\nYellow and pink and\nPowder blue profiles glorifying them\n\nVerse 2: (Common)\nStreet lights and deep nights, cats tryin' to eat right\nRidin' no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes\nSo they can get sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right\nDesires of street life, cars and weed types\nIts hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like\nThe beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like\nGame that is deep, we speak and believe hype\nBanged in the streets has cop left for deep life (?)\nIts steep life, coming up where niggaz is sheep-like\nRappers and hoopers, we strive to be like\nG's with three strikes, seeds that need light\nCheese and recite, needs and BE strife\nThe corner, where struggle and greed fight\nWe write songs about wrong 'cause its hard to see right\nLook to the sky, hoping it will bleed light\nReality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites\nThe corner\n\n(Kanye West)\nI wish I could give you this feelin'\nI wish I could give this feelin'\nOn the corners niggaz rob or kill\nAnd dyin' just to make a livin', huh?\n\n(Spoken: The Last Poets)\nThe corner was our magic, our music, our politics\nFires raised as tribal dances and war cries\nBroke out on different corners\nPower to the people\nBlack power\nBlack is beautiful\n\nVerse 3: (Common)\nBlack church services, murderers, Arabs serving burgers\nAs cats with gold permanents, move they bags as herbalists\nThe dirt isn't just fertile, its people workin' and earnin' this\nThe curb getters go where the cats flow and the current is\nIt's so hot that niggaz burn to live\nThe furnace is, whether money movin', the determined live\nWe talk shit, play lotto, and buy German beers\nIt's so black packed with action that's affirmative\nThe corners\n\n(Kanye West)\nI wish I could give you this feelin'\nI wish I could give this feelin'\nOn the corners niggaz rob or kill\nAnd dyin' just to make a livin', huh?\n\n(Spoken: The Last Poets)\nThe corner was our Rock of Gibraltar, our Stonehenge\nOur Taj Mahal, our monument\nOur testimonial to freedom, to peace, and to love\nDown on the corner\n\n", "album": {"title": "Be_(2005)&&7902", "genre": "Hip Hop", "year": 2005}}, {"title": "Chi-City", "href": "Chi-City&&1112", "artist": {"unique_name": "Common"}, "lyrics": "[Common sample] And you say Chi city\nWe don't stop naw we don't quit\n\nI rap with the passion of Christ, nigga cross me\nTook it outta space and niggas thought they lost me\nI'm back like a chiropract wit b-boy survival rap\nThis ain't '94 Joe we can't go back\nThe game need a makeover\nMy man retired, I'ma \"Takeover\"\nTell these halftime niggas, \"Break's over\"\nI'm raw hustlas getcha bakin' soda\nToo many rape the culture\nLeave rappers with careers and their faith over\nIt's a war goin' on, you can't fake bein' a soldier\nIn the basement listenin' to tapes of Ultramagnetic to the fact the messiah's black\nI turn the TV down we could take it higher than that\nI wonder if these wack niggas realize they wack\nAnd they the reason my people say they tired of rap\nInspired by black Muslims and Christian\nPushin' Cutlasses, dope, and other traditions\nIn the conditions of the city, the city, the city, the city, the city, the city, c'mon\n\nA black figure, in the middle of chaos and gun fire\nSo many raps about rims, I'm surprised niggas ain't become tires\nOn the street you turn code and then go screech\nI tell 'em, \"Fuck 'em!\" like I do the police\nThe beast in runnin' rampant\nI'm in between sheets tryna have sex that's tantric\nBut the ghetto, tryna make a get up stand up anthem\nYou spit hot garbage son of Sanford\nWhat you rappin' for to get fame or get rich?\nI slap a nigga like you\nAnd tell him Rick James bitch\nWitcha Hollywood stories on porches\nWe prolly heard stories on who became rich\nAnd whatever light they hit, we wanna hit the same switch\nYou didn't know where to aim it, you still remain bitch\nI'm forever puttin' words together\nSome'll sever mothers from daughters and fathers from sons\nThe name Com has never been involved in Run\nUnless it's DMC or runnin' these broads to bein' free\nI'm harder than the times, you hardly scary\nHoldin' gats inside, you cats is Halle Berry\nThey ask me where hip hop is goin', it's Chicagoin'\nPoetry's in motion like a picture, now showin'\nIt's the city, the city y'all, the city, the city y'all\nC'mon\n\n", "album": {"title": "Be_(2005)&&7902", "genre": "Hip Hop", "year":

Yussef\nThrough death through conception\nNew breath and resurrection\nFor moms, new steps in her direction\nIn the right way\nTold inside is where the fight lay\nAnd everything a nigga do may not be what he might say\nChicago nights stay, stay on the mind\nBut I write many lives and lay on these lines\nWave the signs of the times\nMany say the grind's on the mind\nShorties blunted-eyed and everyone wonderin' where I'm\nBush pushing lies, killers immortalized\nWe got arms but won't reach for the skies\nWaiting for the Lord to rise\nI look into my daughter's eyes\nAnd realize that I'ma learn through her\nThe Messiah, might even return through her\nIf I'ma do it, I gotta change the world through her\nFurs and a Benz, gramps wantin 'em\nDemons and old friends, pops they hauntin' him\nThe chosen one from the land of the frozen sun\nWhen drunk nights get remembered more than sober ones\nWalk like warriors, we were never told to run\nExplored the world to return to where my soul begun\nNever looking back or too far in front of me\nThe present is a gift\nAnd I just wanna be\n\n", "album": {"title": "Be_(2005)&&7902", "genre": "Hip Hop", "year": 2005}}]
