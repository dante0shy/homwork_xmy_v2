himself a hit for 20 Euro\nTonight, death looks right\nFloating on a sea of lovely red lights\n\nHum drum, through the Centrum\nWindow tricks for curious sons\nThree bodies for your pleasure\nYou see the girl who's looking undone\nPick her out to take her home\nOr get it right there for 70 Euro\nTonight, death looks right\nFloating on a sea of lovely red lights\n\nIts time to lift your eyes\nDaylight follows\n.Steals the joys that bring you sorrow\n\nIn the place where men discover\nThere's a church the red lights cover\nOne sacred one profane\nTwo thoughts attacking each other\nOn the wind the spirit will go through the canals to the Paradiso\nAt night, one red light, lost its fire, turns to white\n\n", "album": {"title": "The_Listening_(2005)&&3113", "genre": "Rock", "year":

body\n\nBaby, this is transformation\nFaster, a fast acceleration\nIts coming on without a hesitation\nYour heart my final destination\nTouching it, my manifestation\nIts taking over with no

wouldn't listen to the husband that cried\nFrom the tops of cathedrals and churches you walked right on by\nYou went your own way\n\nNow you've fallen down, love\nNow you're on your own\nWon't know

walls until they tumble over\n\nYou didn't know you were drinking with demons\nYou wouldn't listen to the angels that cried\nFrom the tops of cathedrals and churches\nYou walked right on by\nYou went

lips upon your skin\nBe the air that you are breathing in...\n\nIn between the flesh and bone\nUnder the skin you found a home\nAll that you saw that can't be shown\nAll of the scenes that can't be known\n\nThink of it, your tummy aches\nThinking of it, you salivate\nLying in bed the mind creates\nPrettier lies, a pretty escape\n\nDressing up with enemies\nMaking friends with your disease\nHitting the ground, you broke your knees\nHit so hard it kills your peace\n\nI wanna be in your eyes again\nWanna be in your eyes and then\nPress my lips upon your skin\nBreathe the air

breaking everything they could break of me\nBut if I have you for me, then I have everything\n\nSip the cup of wine to toast\nHold the break before its broke\nSome cast lots to get the cloak\nAnd some deny the things they know...\nBut they'll remember what was said\nWhen its lifted from the dead...\n\nNothing hidden, it's all exposed\nIt's all in the open and overthrown\nGoing back home with my blood on your clothes\nBlood on your spirit, the blood on the skull\n\nWords to the face, fists were thrown\nHurting so bad, you're hurt and you're torn\nThey left me for dead, and left me alone\nGave me for nothing, but I'm leaving you hope\n\nTaking everything they could take from me\nThey're breaking everything they could break of me\nBut if I have you for me, then I have everything\n\n",
