would see you soon and you, you don't move.\nYou wear your whole life there in circles underneath your eyes.\n\nAll I need to know is how to read between the lines,\nBut you somehow hide it all.\n\nI watched you spill your drink and laugh you're such a drama queen.\nYou always look so good when you wear black and green,\nBut you, you're not fooling anyone.\n\nIt was crowded but I knew that you were close.\nI don't think I like this little game of cat and mouse,\nBut you, you don't show.\nIt was almost 3 o'clock when you walked up to me.\n\nI started to but found that I just could not speak,\nBut you, you looked so prepared.\n\nYou said something and I didn't know what it was.\nI watched your lips move but your voice wasn't loud enough.\nSo I just smiled and nodded that's when you decided to just walk, walk away.\n\nI got this overwhelming feeling like there's something wrong.\nMaybe it's the lighting or this same old song, but it's just all in my mind.\nI watched you walk across the room and then you disappeared.\nI lost you in the crowd beneath the chandelier, and they, they don't care.\n\nYou were on the terrace in the rain.\nI asked you if you would come back in, but you just sighed.\nI could tell that you were crying\nBy the way the mascara ran down your face in such tragic lines.\n\nYou said something and I didn't know what it was.\nI think that you sounded like you were a little drunk.\nSo I looked over your shoulder that's when you said\nI told you so and just walked, walked away.\n\nRan down your face\n\nYou said something and I didn't know what it was.\nSomething about how you tried but you're giving up.\nSo I leaned in for a kiss that's when you said\nI can't do this and just walked, walked away.\n\n", "album": {"title":
