your house, buy your ass groceries\nI wrote the whole treatment to your mf video\nWith adam lounge and ricky 'kid' scotchno\nHundred thousand dollar bail caught up and I called you\nFired my attorney, you helped me get a lawyer\nYou took me in, let me stay out in atlanta\nFacing 15 to life, we bounced out to cali\nYou made sacrifices, recorded on the run\nWe bust our ass, and got ibylis done\nI made a mistake, told the press you hold dough\nI see now it's my fault, they didn't need to know\nI apologized to you, I thought we let it go\nB.b. king's, new york, together did a show\nBut look at us now, once again, here we go\nMoney wasn't worth it, it turned us into foes\nWhenever you had beef, your beef was mine\nI took a life for you, put mine on the line\n\nDoing songs with rza\nThat's funny shit\nI remember you told me\nThat he bit tick, tick...\nYou said ghost was whack\nYou didn't like his style\nTwo-faced and three-headed\nBitch I pull your file\nNew food poisoning\nYou vomit for a while\nYou started some shit\nNow you sitting on a pile\nMetal face, tin foil\nWalk the green mile\n\nHow could you ever diss m.i.c.\nYves st. lerock yes r.i.p.\nHow could you ever diss m.i.c.\nBig al r.i.p.\nHow could you ever diss m.i.c.\nJ. black r.i.p.\nHow could you ever diss m.i.c.\nSubroc r.i.p.\nHow could you ever diss m.i.c.\nK. nit r.i.p.\nHow could you ever diss m.i.c.\nT. collins r.i.p.\nM.i.c.\n\nWhat the fuck happened to you man\nYou fell the fuck off man\nNiggaz used to love you, motherfucker\nCome home man\nCome home, zev (come on)\nDon't let them niggaz brainwash you man\nI know your fans love you man\nThey love you\nYou getting brainwashed\n\n", "album": {"title": "American_Hunger_(2006)&&9802", "genre": "Hip Hop", "year": 2006}}]
