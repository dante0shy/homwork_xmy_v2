everyone watched you as you entered the room\nAnd everyone watched you watching the sky hoping that this night would somehow never end\nAnd you wouldn't have to say \"hey call me tomorrow,\" and say \"farewell\"\n\nThere's just something about the way that she moves\nAll eyes are fixed on her trying to catch a glance of the charm in her eyes\nShe takes a sip of her drink and leaves a lipstick mark on the rim of her glass\nThen her eyes look up at me and I wonder how I could deserve this much\nI didn't know dreams could be this real\nI swear I've been waiting for you my whole life\nI didn't know dreams could be this real\n\nAnd everyone watched you as you entered the room\nAnd everyone watched you watching the sky hoping that this night would somehow never end\nAnd you wouldn't have to say \"hey call me tomorrow,\"\nLet's just clench our fists and hold on as tightly as we can\nAs tightly as we can\n\n", "album": {"title": "Reasons_That_Keep_The_Ground_Near_(2005)&&8086", "genre":

never ending Friday nights are wearing me out,\nBroadway is killing me slowly, but surely,\nI better move fast and get myself out of here\nFaster than I've ever run from anywhere before\nGotta get out of here and run away from all of these concrete covered dreams that I clung so tightly to\nI was disillusioned by the hope that I could find\nSomething so much more amazing than I could ever find back home\nSiren's always blaring and never ending Saturday nights are wearing me out\n\nNo nothing can keep me here (I'd rather drive from town to town than stay here)\n\n", "album": {"title":
