really hate to see you leave\nBut I'd really love to watch you go\nSo if you're thinking about grabbing your keys\nThen I think you better let me know\nCause baby I've been reading your kiss\nAnd there ain't no fire without smoke\nWhen I see the way you throw those hips\nThen I know I gotta take you home\nI gotta love you babe\n'Cause I love to love to love\nTo love to love to love\n\nYou really shook me babe\nGot me cooked and hooked like a junkie\nYou're hot like a rock star\nI've been cocked and shot, but I wannabe\nYou kiss like a butterfly\nSting like a honey bee\nYou got the seven wonders\nAnd I'm going under\nCause you throw me off my feet\nGotta have your number on my phone\nCan't have you going home alone\nI'll never lock you down\nOr fence you round\n'Cause I feel you
