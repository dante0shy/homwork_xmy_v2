world\n\nSitting on (sitting on), sitting on (sitting on)\nSitting, on top of the world\nDiamonds (diamonds), diamonds (diamonds)\nDiamond pearls, and girls\nSitting on (sitting on), sitting on (sitting on)\nSitting, on top of your girl\nShining (shining), shining (shining)\nShining, for the world\n\n(C-Note)\nMy nigga we sitting on top of the world, with diamonds and pearls\nGirls that's addicted like curls, welcome to the world\nSuburbans and the Cadillacs\nCome equipped, with this game 'cause we ain't having that\nI'm about them paper stacks, a hundred thousand yeah they got us a mill\nThe next year around this time, we'll be carrying a bill\nCome down the Boulevard, sideways\nAs I blaze purple haze, and think of many ways\nOr I can keep paper chasing\nOr I can mash on the gas, catch for generation no more Clover hation\nSouthern, gotta throw a platinum party\nAnd if them niggaz want static, shit I brought my 40\nThe Botany Boys, Botany Boys yeah we superstars\nThe Botany Boys, Botany Boys play with platinum toys\nWe coming switching the lane, and flying on planes\nAnd gripping the grain, our show sold out mayn nigga we\n\n(D-Red)\nDreams of a life, full of sunshine\nNo playa hating, from them crooked ass one time\nAnd robbing dead, so it ain't no jacking for my ride\nYou been exposed, to all the finer thangs that life provide\nCan't erase all the pain, that I left behind\nNow across the world I'm flying, counting dollar signs\nMom and pop got acres, far as you could see\nAbout to give two hundred thee, to the community\nTo separate from all the drama, and the violence\nWe set the Clover on the ocean, called it island\nTo keep time, nothing but Roley's being wound up\nTwo story pads, being built from the ground up\nDiamonds scattered, from the iced out bezyltine\nBoppers staring at the Bentley, sitting on 17's\nCounting grands, and the fans showing nothing but love\nLike Note told ya, putting rocks all up in your mug we on top of the world\n\n(Will-Lean)\nSitting on top of the globe, getting blowed\nLike tailor made suits, this game is getting sowed\nWrecking these boys call a truck, they getting towed\nShine up all the pearls, diamonds and all the golds\nWe gon show 'em how we roll, foreigns and limos\nMashing with O do's, glassed out patios\nBlack lacquer fo's, grey matalic Rolls\nPreaching with callicos, leave you with bullet holes\nWe pro fa sho, by these hoes they love clothes\nVersacci Armani, Bobby Joe's and Havanna Jones\nBig Shots, that's sitting on top\nSmash off in my drop, sitting on blocks\nChop chop chop, goes them blades when I floss\nNavigator with the bop, perpetrate they getting tossed\nWrist full of frost, ice gleaming like pearls\nBig Shots, sitting on top of the world\n\n", "album": {"title":

"Coming down wrecking, sitting fat on chrome\nBig body Benz, or the Fleetwood brome\nBitches steady playing, on my prime co. phone\n20 inches on the 4's, on everything that we own\nComing down wrecking, sitting fat on chrome\nBig body Benz, or the Fleetwood brome\nBitches steady playing, on my prime co. phone\nBlazing up the endo, for all my G's that's gone\n\n(C-Note)\nComing down wrecking, switching side to side\nI floss the candy Navigator, with the buck inside\nWhen ya see swang wide, watch the wood grain guide\nTV's falling from the sky, and all the girls wanna ride\nI represent for my side, and all the homies that died\nFrom the streets we bring the heat, watch the 3rd Coast rise\nWhy you looking surprised, you see them screens in the vis'\nShe say she love my Chinese eyes, while I'm rubbing her thighs\nCan I have a shake with them fries, and don't spill nothing on my seat\nIn Laffeyette at the meet, got them freaks for the week\nThere's plenty girls in Atlanta, now just take you a peek\nI got the Burban with the scanner, headed to the Freak-Nic they on dick\n\n(D-Red)\nPlayas night out, Botany peeling up the streets with heat\nWe creep the weed, always clips for the fools that peep\nIt's still 20 inches, twisting on the Rover Jeep with chrome\nWrecking your dome, puffing on a zone\nIt's on, we roam Kapone styling\nLunch meeting on a plane, we just cruise the island\nBug eyeing, smiling front fo' on gleam\nWatch your eyes (bling-bling), D-Red done wrecked the scene\nMillion dollar figga niggaz, with the scratch to win\nWe hit the casino fifty deep, because we bound to win\nTo all in we dumping money, in the back of a Benz\nSipping yack counting stacks, them boys done done it again\n\n(Will-Lean)\nBoppers peeping my game fiending for fame\nScreaming my name, Will-Lean leaving a stain\nBreaking the chain, swerving tipping the lane\nIn my Humvee flipping, gripping the grain\nCatch me on the 3rd Coast, patrolling the fort\nReady to scorch, the boulevard rolling a Porsche\nHolding the course, the Chemist steady stepping on toes\nCoupe Deville with the grill, wrecking on fo's\nBitches throwing me the pussy, you molesting these hoes\nAnd when I see you at the club, I'm disrespecting you hoes\nLetting 'em know fa sho, C-Note let the top down\nHit the switch this for the bitches my nigga, and let the drop clown\n\n(D-Red)\nNow who the hell coming down, calling shots like that\nAnd how the hell them niggaz, make the Benz squat like that\nPopped up on Lorenz, kitted out like that\nYou ain't know the Botany Boys, bleed the block like that\nHit the strip and bust a U, with the trunk on knock\n9-9 and chrome shining, representing Big Shots\nWide body V-12, or a Fleet on fo's\nRocks glaring hoes staring, watch a G get chose\nBending corners under tint, getting gone off flight\nEnough ice to blind sight, and give your ass frostbite\nFully loaded heat toters, stashed under the flo' mat\nCouldn't picture Head shining, close up with a Kodak\nAnd for you suckers talking down, I know you soft as a cushion\nWatch the 20 inches spinning, on the Bentley I'm pushing\nSo when the screens fall down, in the Lac like that\nRemember the Botany Big Shots, come down and wreck like that\n\n", "album": {"title": "Forever_Botany_(1999)&&2187", "genre": "Hip Hop", "year": 1999}}]
