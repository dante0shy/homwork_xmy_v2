to understand.\nThe secret of life,\nWhy am I here to try again?\n\nWill I always, will you always\nSee the truth when it stares you in the face?\nWill I ever, will I never free myself\nBy breaking these chains?\n\nI'd give my heart, give my soul\nI'd turn it back, it's my fault.\nYour destiny is forlorn,\nHave to live till it's undone.\nI'd give my heart, give my soul\nI'd turn it back and then at last I'll be on my way.\n\nI've been living for so long,\nMany seasons passed me by.\nI've seen kingdoms through ages\nRise and fall, I've seen it all.\n\nSeen the horror, seen the wonders\nHappening just in front of my eyes.\nWill I ever, will I never free myself by making it right? \n\nI'd give my heart, give my soul\nI'd turn it back, it's my fault.\nYour destiny is forlorn,\nHave to live till it's undone.\nI'd give my heart, give my soul\nI'd turn it back and then at last I'll be on my way.\n\nJillian our dream ended long ago.\nAll our stories and all our glory I held so dear.\nWe won't be together\nFor ever and ever, no more tears.\nI'll always be here 'til the end.\nJillian, no more tears...\nJillian, no more tears...\n\nI'd give my heart, give my soul\nI'd turn it back, it's my fault.\nYour destiny is forlorn,\nHave to live till it's undone.\nI'd give my heart, give my soul\nI'd turn it back and then at last I'll be on my way.\n\n", "album":

time anymore.\nLife will pass us by,\nWe are forsaken,\nWe're the last of our kind.\n\nThe sacrifice was much too high,\nOur greed just made us all go blind.\nWe tried to hide what we feared inside.\nToday is the end of tomorrow.\n\nAs the sea started rising,\nThe land that we conquered just washed away.\nAlthough we all have tried to turn back the tide,\nIt was all in vain.\n\nNow the day has come,\nWe are forsaken,\nThere's no time anymore.\nLife will pass us by,\nWe are forsaken,\nOnly ruins stay behind.\n\nNow the day has come.\nWe are forsaken this time.\n\nNow the day has
