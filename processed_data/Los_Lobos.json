heal\nBaby dry the tears from your eyes\nAnd take my hand as we walk into the night\nTender are the dreams\nThat we try so hard to hide, so deep inside\n\nI don't know why you go on this way\nNight

times and even worries\nAnd sometimes special folks like you and me\n\nNow it's our turn to make a rhyme for Papa Lalo\nAnd as we sing I'll play the song on my guitar\nIt doesn't matter if the song is good or malo\n'Cause just to sing it makes you feel just like a star\n\nOur Papa Lalo made a blimp from wool and tires\nIt's so big it almost covers the whole sky\nAnd then he filled it full of air with mom's hair dryer\nWe were amazed when Papa showed us it could fly\n\nNow it's our turn to make a rhyme for Papa Lalo\nAnd as we sing I'll play the song on my guitar\nIt doesn't matter if the song is good or malo\n'Cause just to sing it makes you feel just like a star\n\nUp in the air we could touch the clouds and feel the breeze\nWe see the grass and hils and people down below\nWe're flying south so we can meet our Papa's family\nIt's Lalo's birthday and we're going to Mexico\n\nNow it's our turn to make a rhyme for Papa Lalo\nAnd as we sing I'll play the song on my guitar\nIt doesn't matter if the song is good or malo\n'Cause just to sing it makes you feel just like a star\n\n", "album": {"title": "Papa%27s_Dream_(1995)&&7513", "genre": "Rock", "year": 1995}}, {"title": "Luz De Mi
