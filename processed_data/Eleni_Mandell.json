lied, oh, he lied to me\nHe lied when he switched\nWhen he broke with his teeth\nThen he brought this fruit and he laid it at my feet\nHe went down on his belly\nAnd he slithered up a tree\nHe wiggled and he hissed\nWhen he kissed my cheek\nHe said I should've known better\nWhat a feral beast\n\n", "album": {"title": "Wishbone_(1998)&&2816", "genre": "Folk Rock", "year": 1998}}, {"title": "Home",
