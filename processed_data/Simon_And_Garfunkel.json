organdy\nClothed in crinoline\nOf smoky burgundy\nSofter than the rain\n\nI wandered empty streets\nDown past the shop displays\nI heard cathedral bells\nTripping down the alley ways\nAs I walked on\n\nAnd when you ran to me\nYour cheeks flushed with the night\nWe walked on frosted fields\nOf juniper and lamplight\nI held your hand\n\nAnd when I awoke\nAnd felt you warm and near\nI kissed your honey hair\nWith my grateful tears\nOh, I love you, girl\nOh, I love you\n\n", "album": {"title": "Parsley,_Sage,_Rosemary_And_Thyme_(1966)&&7334", "genre": "Folk Rock", "year": 1966}}, {"title":

planted in my brain\nStill remains\nWithin the sound of silence\n\nIn restless dreams I walked alone\nNarrow streets of cobblestone\n'Neath the halo of a streetlamp\nI turned my collar to the cold and damp\nWhen my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light\nThat split the night\nAnd touched the sound of silence\n\nAnd in the naked light I saw\nTen thousand people, maybe more\nPeople talking without speaking\nPeople hearing without listening\nPeople writing songs that voices never shared\nNo one dared\nDisturb the sound of silence\n\n\"Fools,\" said I, \"You do not know\nSilence like a cancer grows\nHear my words that I might teach you\nTake my arms that I might reach you\"\nBut my words like silent raindrops fell\nAnd echoed in the wells of silence\n\nAnd the people bowed and prayed\nTo the neon god they made\nAnd the sign flashed out its warning\nIn the words that it was forming\nAnd the sign said, \"The words of the prophets\nAre written on the subway walls\nAnd tenement halls\nAnd whispered in the sounds of silence\"\n\n", "album": {"title": "Sounds_Of_Silence_(1966)&&9027", "genre": "Folk Rock", "year": 1966}}, {"title": "Old Friends", "href": "Old_Friends&&8172",

shoes of the old friends\n\nOld friends, winter companions, the old men\nLost in their overcoats, waiting for the sunset\nThe sounds of the city sifting through trees\nSettle like dust on the shoulders of the old friends\n\nCan you imagine us years from today\nSharing a park bench quietly?\nHow terribly strange to be 70\n\nOld friends, memory brushes the same years\nSilently sharing the same fears\n\n", "album": {"title": "Bookends_(1968)&&5598", "genre": "Folk Rock", "year": 1968}}, {"title": "Why Don't You Write Me", "href": "Why_Don%27t_You_Write_Me&&6897", "artist":
