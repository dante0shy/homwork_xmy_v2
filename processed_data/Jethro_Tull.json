magical world long since ceased to be,\nWhen the Eve-bitten apple returned to destroy the tree.\n\nIncestuous ancestry's charabanc ride,\nSpawning new millions throws the world on its side.\nSupporting their far-flung illusion, the national curse,\nAnd those with no sandwiches please get off the bus.\n\nThe excrement bubbles,\nThe century's slime decays\nAnd the brainwashing government lackeys\nWould have us say\nIt's under control and we'll soon be on our way\nTo a grand year for babies and quiz panel games\nOf the hot hungry millions you'll be sure to remain.\n\nThe natural resources are dwindling and no one grows old,\nAnd those with no homes to go to, please dig yourself holes.\n\nWe wandered through quiet lands, felt the first breath of snow.\nSearched for the last pigeon, slate grey I've been told.\nStumbled on a daffodil which she crushed in the rush, heard it sigh,\nAnd left it to die.\nAt once felt remorse and were touched by the loss of our own,\nHeld its poor broken head in her hands,\nDropped soft tears in the snow,\nAnd it's only the taking that makes you what you are.\n\nWond'ring aloud will a son one day be born\nTo share in our infancy\nIn the child's path we've worn.\nIn the aging seclusion of this earth that our birth did surprise\nWe'll open his eyes.\n\n", "album": {"title": "Living_In_The_Past_(1972)&&8478", "genre": "Progressive

the summer crying\nNow summer cannot come anyway\n\nI had waited for time to change her\nThe only change that came was over me\nShe pretended not to want love\nI hope she was only fooling me\n\nSo when you look into the sun\nLook for the pleasures nearly won\nOr was it better then to run\nThan to spend the summer singing\nAnd summer could have come in a day\n\nSo if you hear my sad song singing\nRemember who and what you nearly had\nIt's not easy singing sad songs\nWhen you can sing the song to make me glad\n\nSo when you look into the sun\nAnd see the words you could have sung\nIt's
