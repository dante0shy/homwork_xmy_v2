think your mom's beeping\nWord that's her number no doubt\nYo I'ma break out\nFirst I get some Chinese take out\nAnd scope jake out\nPark out on the corner of your mothers building waiting for me\nBut I broke out before the story\nAnd those devils never saw me\n\nTo my kids sold in sheets\nRap freaks\nAll you tricks in heat\nWe'll crack your beef for being sweet\nDon't even try to sleep I'm full

in shades Heavy D ate my blades\nFeather-base pumps like Flavor Flav\nI shed scenes on dark days\nFriend of all angels on fatal car chase\nDrive through the flatlands till I hit ralph\nCaught the stench of the rotten projects\nBagger left and I'm out\n\nNon-Phixion be the full monty\nSaw ya off like Vinnie Ponty\nI'm Noam Chomsky, nah\nFucking like Phil Bronski\nI'm ill constantly\nKill with the velocity T3\nThree years before the movie got out\nAnd Ja Rule be with the gat out gotta give a shout out\nTo Goretex and Teikei engineerin' this, steerin' this\nJust like a love boat\nOr William S Borroughs' rough coat\nSmell the gun smoke\nYou get thug broke\nLike uncut coke\nWith no client to sell it to\nInternal Revenue\nThere's many levels to the train of thought\nWe taking over
