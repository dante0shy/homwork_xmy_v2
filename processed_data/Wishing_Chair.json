way to start\nAll this sneaking round\nIt just brings us down but\nIt's OK\nWe will find a way\nSometimes you just gotta stand and say\n\nYou're the only one that I want\nYou're the only one that I need\nI can see you walking right beside me\nSometimes baby\nYou just got to believe\n\nIt's too quiet\nThis ticking clock\nLaughing at me waisting time\nBeen holding out for a miracle\nAnd I know that you are mine but\nIt's OK\nWe will find a way\nSometimes you just gotta stand and say\n\nYou're the only one that I want\nYou're the only one that I need\nI can see you walking right beside me\nSometimes baby\nYou just got to believe\n\nIt's as clear as the summer sky\nBright and staring at the sun\nI can see it right before my eyes saying\nYou're the one\nYou're the one\nYou're the one\n\nI'm sitting here in this Wishing Chair\nMy heart is spinning like a top\nBeen picking daisies three at a time\nDoes she love me, loves me not\nIt's OK\nWe will find a way\nSometimes you just gotta stand and say\n\nYou're the only one that I want\nYou're the only one that I need\nI can see you walking right beside me\nSometimes baby\nYou just got to believe\n\nYou're the only one that I want\nYou're the only one that I need\nI can see you walking right beside me\nSometimes baby\nYou just got to believe\nSometimes baby\nYou just got to believe\nSometimes baby\nYou just got to\nBelieve\n\nBelieve\nBelieve\nBelieve\n\n", "album": {"title": "Undisputed_Country_(1998)&&6097", "genre": "Folk", "year": 1998}}, {"title": "Undisputed Country", "href":

wise\nWho shares the eyes\nThat I am seeing now\n\nThere's no need for pretending\nJust be the one you are\nA changing thing with a light within\nAs bright as any star\nIn our undisputed
