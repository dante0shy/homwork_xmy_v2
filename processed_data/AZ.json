tried it wit peace\nBut it's like niggas ain't happy till they finally deceased\nFeel the grief, of a street, nigga that turned to rap\nAnd just applied everything that he learned from crack\nI'm in now, it's life ain't no turning back\nIt been foul so what kinda concerns is that\nPeep the signs of the eyes 'cause it tell it all\nOne of the few in the streets that was selling it raw\nMade mistakes, but it made me intelligent more\nAnd how I move, you could still look and tell I was poor\nHow can the hate from another man stop my flow\nThat's like another pimp thinking he can knock my hoe\nI'm here now, just trying to copp and blow\nCouple of cars and lot's of doe\n\nFrom the corners of street, in every hood and every ghetto\nI'm the proof of what could be, if you try\nIf you wanna

niggas seen 'em lean and crawl\nWhat makes a man wanna fiend for more\nLife itself is more than a trial or a quest\nIntelligent wise, it's like I done ran with the best\nAnd very rarely, you can catch me casually dressed\nI'm more relaxed in a hat and some sweats\nDoing me, been amongst some of the street's most strongest men\nAround for months then they gone again\nIncarcerated, penalized for the love of they acts\nCriminals, cold-hearted, now what's fucing wit that?\nWhere we at? hit inside of a life that's rarely exposed\nSpoken in codes for the killers that daily'll dose\nGet yours, hit a quota then get indoors\nGet legit then get them stores\n\nFrom the corners of street, in every hood and every ghetto\nI'm the proof of what could be, if you try\nIf you wanna try\nAll the haters wanna see\nA niggas life in misery\nBut I'ma keep on doing me, till I die\n\nSo now it's on y'all, could see, I done figured it out\nOnly a few could say that they been in my house\nAnd caroused at my wall color, blend with my couch\nI'm as low as you can go in the south\nWhen it's too deep, it's hard for the mind to relate\nSome say I'm too street and way too involved wit the snakes\nWhat make a man bigger that life, I'm twice his age\nUnderstand I'm a sinner but I'm nice some ways\nKnee-deep in what I speak 'cause I spit the truth\nI become angelic when I sit in the booth\nJust a thought of all the ill shit that lurk in streets\nHow can another real nigga wanna work wit police\nBad enough you got thiefs and the beef is rough\nI took an oath just to smoke, eat, sleep and fuck\nKnowledge of self, I'ma do this regardless of wealth\nRegardless of how the deck and how the cards get dealth\n\nFrom the corners of street, in every hood and every ghetto\nI'm the proof of what could be, if you
