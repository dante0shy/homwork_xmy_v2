in\nOh I know it isn't cheap\nIt keeps me on my feet\nAnd when I've made a million\nThat's when I finally walk away\nI wanna walk away\n\n", "album": {"title": "Twenty_Four_Seven_(2000)&&498",

starting over in a brand new day\nBeing a beggar on an oily old rag\nIs not a living for me\n\nI'm not offended by the modern day\nI burn a candle for the friends that I made\nSee you round, maybe in
