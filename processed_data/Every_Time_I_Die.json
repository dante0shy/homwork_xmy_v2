witness.\nThis is doom in a borrowed suit.\nIt's a pickup line at a funeral.\nCannibals along side the catwalk.\n\nBut it's ok we've got old blood and our veins are rooted to the hornets nest again.\nNew love is tasteless.\n\nWe're wearing down.\nThis is the year of the party crasher.\n\nWhat is charm?\nWhere are the heroics?\nWhat is harm to the perfumed wrists of the stoics?\n\nDesigner impostors find us twitching in the claws of the snake.\nA fin is circling around in the floor.\nIt appears we've lost our way.\nThe tide is swelling and we've fallen asleep on the shore.\nGet inside.\n\nSomeone's yelling fire...\nIn the theater.\n\nOh, dear God, Everybody stay calm.\nTell your husband that his screaming just invited it in.\n\nThe horsemen are crashing through the gates.\n\nWe had better learn to play dead.\nOur hands are reeking of rapture.\nIt's dripping from our chins.\nThe tragedy of infant hearts.\n\nBut it's ok we've got old blood and our hair is woven to the same hotel again.\nNew love is tasteless.\n\nWe're wearing down.\nThis is the year of the party crasher.\n\n'Cause it's you and me for the first time in history.\nWe're history.\n\n", "album":

great American mischief has muted our hearts\nAnd our rhythms are met with the inharmonious grunts of electric guitars.\nIt's all but too much.\nSo nobody out there believes the obscene are reprieved.\nEverybody get fed up.\n\nMy baby better get high cause, I've got something that I need to confess.\nThe dead men talking are longing for so much more than simply the obvious.\nCut us off.\nWe're suffering, hysterical, lighting the flare from the foot of her bed.\nI've been begging you for less mercy than this.\nBut the only thing you need to know, is that you never wanted to know.\n\nTake it off, take it back, or take cover because we're nearing a nerve.\nDead is wasted on the patient, so make haste and head for the wake.\n\nNow the hornets inhabit the hearts we've abandoned.\nWe are gone.\nCast aside our clothes like funeral roses, and dance straight through the psalm.\nI was right all along\n\nI'm dead, in the water.\nDon't come for me.\nI was once alive in the desert's eyes on the day it wed the sea.\nI drew a chalk outline around your city.\nI hushed the sobs in your halls.\nBut we both know that it's killer, baby he'll outrun them all.\nThere is so much shame in how little we've gained for so long.\n\nNow the sky is falling.\nAnd you're just repeating everything I say.\nAnd you're not listening close enough,\nIt's a catastrophe.\n\nYou have not been concentrating.\nPay attention there will be an exam.\nBuild an ark.\nBuild an ark.\n\nCome bring us back to the ruin.\nDrifting out of our heads.\nTaped off the sky above your city.\nDusted for prints on the chapel wall.\nBut we all know that it's killer, baby I will outrun them all.\n\n", "album": {"title": "Gutter_Phenomenon_(2005)&&6420", "genre": "Metalcore", "year": 2005}}, {"title":

starry-eyed\n\nWe both want the same thing\nBetter aim at the stranger in our yard\nJust try to stop me\nI am the blinding light of your life\nPrepare the body\nI've been better but thanks for
