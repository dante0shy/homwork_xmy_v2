staying locked up inside?\n\nAnd I can't take the truth of all the lies anymore\nIs there no end in sight?\nHave we lost the fight\nTo the war inside?\n\nOh Lord, help me learn to fly\nI feel I'm

to this selfish sin\nI need to rise above\nHow many hearts does it take to start\nThe healing within?\nThere's hope for all who hear the call\nTo the kingdom, yeah\n\nAnd I can't take the truth of all

before I went to sleep\nLater when I was dreaming, I guess I decided to take that leap\nAs I was falling through the nighttime sky the ground was nowhere in sight\nThen I met up with this TV that was falling through the night\nSo I tuned it in to try to catch my last episode of Cheers\nInstead, I saw my friends and family with eyes all full of tears\nI wondered: why are they crying on such a sunny sunny day?\nOne looked at me and said it was 'cause I'd thrown my life away\n\nThe screen jumped back to a time when I still alive\nI think it took me back to when I was just about five\nIt quickly took me through all the events of my life\nIt showed me all the good times and it showed me all the strife\nBut in seeing all these old events, there was something new to see\nYou see, I was helping people, and there were people helping me\nI guess I never realized that I had done any good\nAnd it gave my heart a boost just to know that I could\n\nI kept on watching just to see what else there was\nAnd I played a little with the tuning, I don't know why, just because\nWell the next scene on the screen was one I had never seen before\nIt was a strange room in a strange place with a purple paisley door\nOf all the faces there, there were some I recognized\nBut I could see there was something missing, I could see it in their eyes\nOne looked at me and told me what was missing from all these souls\nI was supposed to meet them and instead I left a hole\n\nWell the screen to black and the TV went away\nAnd there I sat falling with nothing much left to say\nI realized that things were pretty good, and my life had meaning too\nAnd that jumping off this building was kind of a stupid thing to do\nThere was however one slight flaw with this revelation I'd seen\nThe ground was fast approaching, and looking very mean\nThere's nothing I could do at this point to change my destiny\n'Cause you simply cannot change the laws of gravity\n\n", "album": {"title":
