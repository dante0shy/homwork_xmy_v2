home she wasn't recognized\nShe must have changed a lot she realized\nShe feels new\nShe feels strong\nShe feels young\nShe can do\nWhat she wants\n'Cause her past\nHas disappeared\n\nHer life is an open book\nWith no demands\nBella is grateful for the\nGolden chance\n\nTo rub off her mistakes\nAnd regrets\nFrom tonight\nShe'll break loose\nFrom restraints\nBy starting over\n\nBella\nBella's at the point of zero\nStarting from the outset tonight\nBella struttin' like a hero\nCelebrating that she's leaving tonight\n\nTonight\nTonight\n\nIt's like a fairy tale\nA time machine\nBella forgets who she has ever been\n\nShe's reborn\nShe's rebuilt and refilled\nShe is torn\nFrom her past\nAnd tonight\nIs her renaissance\n\nBella\nBella's at the point of zero\nStarting from the outset tonight\nBella struttin' like a hero\nCelebrating that she's leaving\n\nBella\nBella's at the point of zero\nStarting from the outset tonight\nBella struttin' like a hero\nCelebrating that she's leaving tonight\n\nFrom tonight she can be anyone\nBut will never take the part of bella\nShe has no history anymore\nShe has no present\nThere is no future behind the door\nThere is no substance\n\nBella\nBella's at the point of zero\nStarting from the outset tonight\nBella struttin' like a hero\nCelebrating that she's leaving tonight\n\n", "album": {"title":

about\nShe wears her sweater inside-out\nShe's bewildered and led astray\nShe brought the wrong books for school today\n\nHer black umbrella is opened up\nShe hasn't noticed the rain has stopped\nShe talks with people who aren't there\nShe looks through glasses she doesn't wear\n\nLike melted chocolate ice\nLike withered edelweiss\nShe's winged and yet she flies\nLike a naked clown lacking her disguise\n\nShe is grateful for the clouceur\nBut the prize is not for her\nShe's laid open to attack\nWhen the door locks behind her back\n\nAs she waves her magic wand\nThere's a whisper of despond\nShe is painfully unaware\nThat the rabbit isn't there\n\n", "album": {"title": "Closer_(2004)&&1360", "genre": "Jazz", "year": 2004}}, {"title": "September", "href": "September&&1057",
