for a wall of stone.\n\nWarning signs are flashing ev'ry where, but we pay no heed \n'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a pickin' up speed \nDisaster's getting closer ev'ry time we meet \nGoing

younger men\nOld, young, age don't carry weight\nIt doesn't matter in the end\n\nOne of the boss' hangers-on\nSometimes comes to call\nAt times you least expect\nTryin' to bully you, strongarm you, inspire you with fear\nIt has the opposite effect\n\nThere's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town\nThe other one is long gone\n10 foot, 2 foot, 6 across\nBurns with the bark still on\n\nThey say times are hard\nIf you don't believe it you can follow your nose\nIt don't bother me, times are hard everywhere\nWe'll just have to see how it goes\n\nMy old man, he's like some feudal lord\nHe's got more lives than a cat\nI've never seen him quarrel with my mother even once\nThings come alive or they fall flat\n\nYou can smell the pine wood burnin'\nYou can hear the school bell ring\nGot to

Cumberland, the Tennessee\nAll the rest of them rebel rivers\n\nIf you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again\nYou do so at the peril of your life\nI'm not quite as cool, or forgiving as I sound\nI've seen enough heartache and strife\n\nMy grandfather was a duck trapper\nHe could do it with just dragnets and ropes\nMy grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth\nI don't know if they had any dreams or hopes\n\nI had 'em once, though I suppose\nTo go along with all the ring dancing\nChristmas carols on all the Christmas eves\nI left all my dreams and hopes\nBuried under tobacco leaves\n\nNot always easy kicking someone out\nGot to wait awhile, it can be an unpleasant task\nSometimes somebody wants you to give something up\nAnd tears or not, it's too much to ask\n\n",
