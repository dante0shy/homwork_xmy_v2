\n\nIf I had you here, I'd clip your wings \nSnap you up and leave you sprawling on my pin \nThis plan of mine is oh so very lame \nCan't you see the grass is greener where it rains \n\nYou left, I died, \nI went and you cried \nYou came, I think \nBut I never really know \nI've served my time \nI've watched you climb \nThe wrong incline \nBut what do I know \n\nAccept it, Don't let it \nTurn the screw \nAccept it, And let it \nScream back at you \n\nNow this applies both equally to you and I \nThe only thing we share \nIs the same sky \nThese empty metaphors \nThey're all in vain \nLike can't you see the grass is greener where it rains \n\nIn the garden Snake was a charmin' \nAnd Eve said let's give it a try \nNow lead us not into temptation \nBut no matter how hard I try \nWhen in the garden and \nSnake is a charmin' \nAnd Eve says let's give it a try \nEve is the apple of my eye \n\nAnd I lie behind you \nAnd a cradle you in the palm of me \nAnd I pat your hair down \nI think will we sink or swim? \n'Cause we could do either on a whim\n\n", "album": {"title": "Flock_(2005)&&4663", "genre": "Rock", "year": 2005}}, {"title": "Daybreak", "href": "Daybreak&&9908", "artist":
