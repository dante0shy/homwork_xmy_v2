Am I free fall? \nIf it lasts forever it will feel like nothing at all, nothing at all \nSo I dreamt to be impossible with me, reaching higher \nAnd it helped me make it through the night \nBut I see everything simpler \nAs a walk on the higher wire \nAnd I will never believe that it will be alright... alright...\n\n", "album": {"title": "All_Lost_(2006)&&4247", "genre": "Indie Pop", "year": 2006}}, {"title": "No One Can Know", "href": "No_One_Can_Know&&4629", "artist": {"unique_name": "Monster_Movie"}, "lyrics": "It's written over window panes and glass \nI can see the words on moon lit baths \nTime can always turn on us so fast \nNo one will remember what we say \n\nNo one you pass knows about our past \nSo don't worry if you break my heart soon \nJust let's end it all now not about ourselves \nNo point in reminiscing it's killing time \n\nFinger prints on dusted canvas walls \nBorn a mental birds all bound in gold \nNo one ever reads them anymore \nNo one ever cared for what they said \nNo one can know \nOur futures never sure \n\nSo don't worry if you \nDon't know how or why \nSomeone will say \nThey know a better way \nBut don't listen to them \nI mean no harm to you \nL.A.
