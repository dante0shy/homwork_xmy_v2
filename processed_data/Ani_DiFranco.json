that you can be\nBe all that you can be\n\nIn hospitals and schools\nAirports and banks and bars\nBig ones on street corners\nLittle ones driving by in cars\nGlowing through countless\nBedroom curtains at night\nThat 20k tone\nAnd that pale blue light\nSaying\nDaddy knows best\nYes, this is the news\nIn 90-second segments\nOfficially produced\nAnd aired again and again and again\nBy the little black and white pawns\nOf the network yes men\nWhile the stars are going out\nAnd the stripes are getting bent\n\nCancer, the great teacher\nHas been opening schools\nDownstream from every factory\nStill, everywhere fools\nAre squinting into microscopes\nResearching cells\nTrying to figure out a way\nWe can all live in hell\nWell\nStep back\nLook up\nYou'll see I'm dimming the sun\nBut you won't, will you?\nNo, that's a good little one\n\n'Cause daddy knows best\nYes, this is the news\nIn 90-second segments\nOfficially produced\nAnd aired again and again and again\nBy the little

women who are\nSurrounded by children in a car\nSurrounded by cars\nOr manhattan was a project\nThat projected the worst of mankind\nFirst one and then the other\nHas made its mark on my mind\n\nIt's sixty years later\nNear the hypo-center of the a-bomb\nI'm in the middle of hiroshima\nWatching a twisted old eucalyptus tree wave\nOne of the very few lives that survived and lives on\nRemembering the day it was suddenly\nThousands of degrees in the shade\nAnd what all of nature gave birth to\nTerror took in a blinding ray\nWith the kind of pain\nIt would take cancer so many years just to say\n\nOh to grow up gagged and blindfolded\nA man's world in your little girl's head\nThe voice of the great mother drowned out\nIn the constant honking\nHaunting the car crash up ahead\nOh to grow up hpynotized\nAnd then try to shake yourself awake\n'Cause you can sense what has been lost\n'Cause you can sense what is at stake\n\nYeah, so\nIt took me a few years to catch on\nThat those days I catch everyone's eye\nCorrespond with those nights of the month\nWhen the moon gleams like an egg in the sky\nAnd men are using a sense\nThey don't even know they have\nJust to watch me walk by\nAnd me, I'm supposed to be sensible\nLeave my animal outside to cry\n\nBut when all of nature conspires\nTo make me her glorious whore\nIt's 'cause in my body I hold the secret recipe\nOf precisely what life is for\nAnd the patriarchy that looks to shame me for it\nIs the same one making war\nAnd I've said too much already\nBut I'll tell you something more\n\nTo split yourself in two\nIs just the most radical thing you can do\nSo girl if that shit ain't up to you\nThen you simply are not free\n'Cause from the sunlight on my hair\nTo which eggs I grow to term\nTo the expression that I wear\nAll I really own is me\nYes to split yourself in two\nIs just the most radical thing you can do\nGoddess forbid that little atom\nShould grow so jealous of eve\nAnd in the face of the great farce\nOf the nuclear age\nFeminism ain't about equality\nIt's about reprieve\n\n", "album": {"title": "Reprieve_(2006)&&7162", "genre": "Indie Rock", "year": 2006}}, {"title": "Subconscious", "href":
