We load glocks and squeeze, say, \"Fuck all these roadblocks!\" Busted a \"U\", then put that bitch in reverse, and I hit the switch, and I push the button. That boy came out the trunk, and put it in drive. Sent this Souljah boy walkin' back in the other direction. Po-po came quick, them heat up. Niggas glanced at each other, opened up they doors, and they kicked they feet up. I jumped outta the car, had to jump over the hood, 'cause I'm headed straight for the woods.
