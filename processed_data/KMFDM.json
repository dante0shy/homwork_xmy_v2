bed you have made\n\nThe feeling is gone and the circle is broken\nLike water under a burning bridge\nA million words but nothing is spoken\nA deafening silence replaced by fear\n\nSave me\nI can't find my way home\nThe grace I've fallen from\nThe only truth I've ever known\n\nSo when you tell me what You tell me, I can't take it anymore\nThe same old story goes around and around\nYou think that if you speak a little louder than you did before\nThe point you make might somehow stick around\n\nIf empathy is no more than a token\nI cry a river in the pouring rain\nThe princess still sleeps but she will be woken\nHer kiss of love is killing me\n\nSave me\nI can't find my way home\nThe ground I'm walking on\nThe only friend I've ever known\n\nMother, father\nThe battle I fight is for no one\nNo one but myself\nBrother, sister\nThe devil inside is my own now\nThere's no way you could understand\nYou don't understand\n\nSave me\nI can't find my way home\nSave me\n\nMother, father\nThe tears that you cry are for no one\nNo one but yourself\nBrother, sister\nI travel this road on my own now\nThere's no way you could understand\n\nSave me\nI can't find my way home\nThe grace I've fallen from\nThe only truth I've ever known\n\nSave me\nI can't find my way home\nThe ground I'm walking on\nThe only friend I've ever known\n\n", "album": {"title": "Attak_(2002)&&5431", "genre":
