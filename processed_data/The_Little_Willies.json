soon learned she loved those bright lights\nMore than she loved me\nSo I'm going back on that same train\nThat brought me here before\nWhile my baby walks the streets of Baltimore\nWhile my baby walks

the Tennessee stud\n\nI had some trouble with my sweetheart's pa\nOne of her brothers was a bad outlaw\nI sent her a letter by my Uncle Fud\nAnd I rode away on the Tennessee stud\n\nThe Tennessee stud was long and lean\nThe color of the sun and his eyes were green\nHe had the nerve and he had the blood\nAnd there never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud\n\nOne day I was ridin' in the beautiful land\nAnd ran smack into an Indian band\nThey jerked their knives with a whoop and a yell\nBut I rode away like a bat out of hell\n\nWell I circled their camp for a time or two\nAnd showed what a Tennessee hoss could do\nAnd them redskin boys never got my blood\n'Cause I was a-ridin' on the Tennessee stud\n\nThe Tennessee stud was long and lean\nThe color of the sun and his eyes were green\nHe had the nerve and he had the blood\nAnd there never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud\n\nWe drifted on down into no man's land\nWe crossed the river called the Rio Grande\nI raced my hoss with the Spaniards bold\nTill I got me a skin full of silver and gold\n\nMe and a gambler we couldn't agree\nWe got in a fight over Tennessee\nWe jerked our guns, he fell with a thud\nAnd I got away on the Tennessee stud\n\nThe Tennessee stud was long and lean\nThe color of the sun and his eyes were green\nHe had the nerve and he had the blood\nAnd there never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud\n\nWell, I got as lonesome as a man can be\nDreamin' of my girl in Tennessee\nThe Tennessee stud's green eyes turned blue\n'Cause he was a-dneamin' of a sweetheart too\n\nWe loped on back across Arkansas\nI whipped her brother and I whipped her pa\nI found that girl with the golden hair\nAnd she was ridin' on a Tennessee mare\n\nThe Tennessee stud was long and lean\nThe color of the sun and his eyes were green\nHe had the nerve and he had the blood\nAnd there never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud\n\nStirrup to stirrup and side by side\nWe crossed the mountains and the valleys wide\nWe came to Big Muddy and we forded the flood\nOn the Tennessee mare and the Tennessee stud\n\nPretty little baby on the cabin floor\nLittle hoss colt playin' 'round the door\nI love the girl with golden hair\nAnd the Tennessee stud loves the Tennessee mare\n\nThe Tennessee stud was long and lean\nThe color of the sun and his eyes were green\nHe had the nerve and he had the blood\nAnd there never was a hoss
