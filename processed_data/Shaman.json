future, our hope\nThere was something in the air,\nThe Age of the Unknown\nFar beyond the sea of trees\nThe vision laid close\n\nThere's a place where the sun shines brighter\nThere's a mountain that climbs to the stars...\n\nDay and night we built a reign\nWith heavenly desire\nSweat and dreams made up the bricks\nThat raised up our walls\n\nPaying tribute to the gods\nAnd blood kept on flowing\nAnd the lust for knowledge\nWas the sense of it all\n\nFly, fly to the stars,\nReach them on high\nBring back the answers of the night\nRoll with the clouds,\nSing with the birds,\n'Cause one day we'll have to say goodbye!\n\nHere we go, carrying no longer sorrow\nStanding up in the wind\nWalk along, marching on for tomorrow\nIn this neverending way\n\nMany years of harmony\nThe message arrived soon\nThree big stars lined up together\nA chill in the air...\n\nThe high-priest was dressed in black\nOn top of the stairways\nLonging for the sacrifice\nOf those who would dare\n\nFly, fly to the stars\nThen let it fall\nInto the emptiness of night\nOur time has come\nTime to move on\n'Cause one day we have to say goodbye...\n\nHere we go, carrying no longer sorrow\nStanding up in the wind\nWalk along, marching on for tomorrow\nIn this neverending way\n\nCome with me to Paradise\nLet's return again,\nLet's return again!\n\nTo be closer to the skies\nLiving on a dream,\nLiving on a dream...\n\nHere we go, carrying no longer sorrow\nStanding up in the wind\nWalk along, marching on for tomorrow\nIn this neverending way\n\n", "album": {"title": "Ritual_(2002)&&1476", "genre":
