by\nBut for me they drug on and on\nWe were loadin' up that Chevy\n\nBoth tryin' not to cry\nMama kept on talkin' puttin' off goodbye\nThen she took my hand and said\nBaby don't forget\n\nBefore you hit the highway you better stop for gas\nAnd there's a fifty in the ashtray in case you run short on cash\nHere's a map and here's a Bible if you ever lose your way\nJust one more thing before you leave\nDon't forget to remember me\n\nThis downtown apartment sure makes me miss home\nAnd those bills there on the counter\nKeep tellin' me I'm on my own\nJust like every Sunday I called mama up last night\nAnd even when it's not I tell her everything's all right\nBefore we hung up I said \nHey mama don't forget\n\nTo tell my baby sister I'll see her in the fall\nTell mee-maw that I miss her yeah I should give her a call\nAnd make sure that you tell daddy that I'm still his little girl\nYeah I still feel like I'm where I'm supposed to be\nBut don't forget to remember me\n\nTonight I find myself kneelin' by the bed to pray\nHaven't done this in a while so I don't know what to say\nBut Lord I feel so small sometimes in this big old place\nYeah I know there's more important things\nBut don't forget to remember me\nDon't forget to remember me\n\n", "album": {"title": "Some_Hearts_(2005)&&8985", "genre": "Country", "year": 2005}}, {"title": "Lessons Learned", "href":
