of day,\nThrew a Roosevelt dime in a bucket of rain.\nOh, oh, oh, oh...\nOh, oh, oh, oh...\n\nNow hold your hand up to the plow, work the dirt 'til the sun goes down.\nWhat's left of death is more than fear, let dust be dust and the good Lord near.\nIt's a little too much to ask of faith, a little too late to wait for fate,\nSo tell the angels what you've seen, scarecrow's shadow on the Nazarene.\nOh, oh, oh, oh...\nOh, oh, oh, oh...\n\nKindness will find you when darkness is falling 'round your bend.\nKindness will follow, children will wander 'til the end.\n\n", "album": {"title":
