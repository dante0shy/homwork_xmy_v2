feet dragging on the floor\nAlways late, but when he's questioned he can't think of what to say\nHides the bruises from the teachers hoping that they go away\nEven though his mom and dad they both got problems of their own\nCaught in a catch 22 but he'd still rather be at home\nCrys himself to sleep and prays when he wakes up things might have changed\nBut everythings still the same\n\n(But didn't you say) You always said that I should speak up, Mmm...\nBut it seems like all the things you said to me before mean nothing at all\nBecause...\n\nI keep telling you that Johnny's hitting me\nThat's why I'm late for school (but you never listen)\nInstead you always seem to end up blaming me for things I didn't do (For what it's worth)\nI didn't even want to tell you anything incase it made things worse (Just so you know)\nEvery time I say that Johnny's hitting me\nHey Mom and Dad it hurts\n\nEveryday keeps on repeating like the record on replay\nSlowly getting off the bus with Johnny waiting at the gates\nLike a friend smiling and waiveing and called him out his name\nPut his arm around his neck what's up now gimme all your change\nToo afraid to make a scene or plead with him to let him go\nHe just takes whatevers coming, feels the pain with every blow\nTrys in vain to make himself be heard as soon as he gets home\nBut everythings still the same...\n\n(But didn't you say) You always said that I should speak up, Mmm...\nBut it seems like all the things you said to me before mean nothing at all\nBecause...\n\nI keep telling you that Johnny's hitting me\nThat's why I'm late for school (but you never listen)\nInstead you always seem to end up blaming me for things I didn't do (For what it's worth)\nI didn't even want to tell you anything incase it made things worse (Just so you know)\nEvery time I say that Johnny's hitting me\nHey Mom and Dad it hurts\n\nYou always said that I should speak up, Mmm...\nAnd to never be afraid to come and tell you if I needed to talk (If I needed to talk, Yeah)\nWell I don't know the meaning of love, Mmm...\nCause it seems like all the things you said to me before mean nothing at all\n\n(Mean nothing at all)\nBecause...\n\n<b>Chorus 3x (Fade Out):</b>\nI keep telling you that Johnny's hitting me\nThat's why I'm late for school (but you never listen)\nInstead you always seem to end up blaming me for things I didn't do (For what it's
