more\nMy car's been broke down for three months\nI can't even go to the store to buy some blunts\nIf my dog could talk he'd ask me why I don't feed him\nGo to the other dogs say I don't need him\nHe's ok but some how I gotta beat him\nMy girl left me for another girl kinda crazy\nI guess it's 'cause I'm fat and sometimes lazy\nIf I don't go to work I guess there not gonna pay me\nSomehow someway I know I'm gonna make it\nI'm not bling blingin but at least I didn't fake it\nSeems like nothing's changing but the weather\nShit can't get any worse now so\nWhen's it gonna get better\nBut any way's that's just how I feel today\nHere's an example what it's like to be me\nLiving like this you know it ain't that easy\nI found my remote but know I can't find my TV\nI'm sitting on my couch watchin time pass\nIf you call low class you can kiss my ass\nThe problems I got you must not got them\nWell there's nowhere to fall when you're sitting on the bottom\nJust sipping on this bottle tryin' to solve them\nI'm out here desperate as all hell\nTryin' to make a living stealin penny's from the wishing well\nSomehow someway I know I'm gonna make it\nWhat ever y'all dish you know I'm gonna take it\nSeems like nothing's changing but the weather\nShit can't get any worse now so\nWhen's it gonna get better\nBut any way's that's just how I feel today\nSeems like nothing's changing but the weather\nShit can't get any worse now so\nWhen's it gonna get better\nBut any way's that's just how I feel today\nAnd tomorrow I probably feel a different way\nAnd that's OK\n'Cause it's my life, my life in the summertime\n\n", "album": {"title": "ForThemAsses_(2004)&&854", "genre": "Ska Punk", "year": 2004}}, {"title": "Sound System", "href": "Sound_System&&6424", "artist": {"unique_name":

we call home\nHell yeah we live like kings fuck bling bling\nTake a look at all these beautiful things\nEvery single day the sunshine state\nEvery single meal avocado on my plate\nEvery single girl got a beautiful face\nHell yeah I love this place\nKali kings on the beach we sing\nAin't really trippin' on a thing\nCan't really be worried\nAbout what tomorrow brings\nKali kings on the beach we sing\nAin't really trippin' on a thing\nCan't really be worried\nAbout what tomorrow brings\nI come from the coast with the most\nA host for parasites up close in tight long summer nights\nI ain't talkin' shit I ain't braggin'\nMy pants are still saggin' and I'm still taggin'\nGrew up on the beach so that's where I got slurs in my speech\nI got stitches from skatin' ditches\nWe call 'em hynas not bitches\nI'm devout to chillin' out\nThis lifestyle here is what I'm all about\nNo matter how we figure it out\nJust keepin' real y'all no doubt\nLife style so simplistic all y'all must of missed it\nDon't understand how we get on the pimp shit\nLive it every single day\nIt's just another sunny day in LA\nCome on Cali\nEvery single day the sunshine state\nEvery single meal avocado on my

sunshine on my mind al the time\nFriends like these are hard to find\nWe're just some cats with some tats\nStill misunderstood\nStill hangin' out in the neighborhood\nIt's all good we're just doin' our thing\nKickin' back with Johnny Richter and the Kottonmouth Kings\nNow there's a new face gracin' this fat ass track\nSwingin' harder than a motherfuckin' baseball bat\nI'm comin' strong repin' Cali all day long\nSee we the kings of California home to bongs and thongs\nNow from the 310 to the 714\nSo many people down to clown when it's time to get raw\nDon't try to test the waters we like hungry piranhas\nWe'll leave you in a state of trauma\nCryin' screamin' for your momma\nIt's time to stand tall and take a look all around\nRemember where you're from I'm from P town\nTime to go and chase your childhood dreams\nTime to learn to fly so go and spread your wings\nOpen up your eyes take off your shades and see\nYou got to aim high you gotta believe\nDo what you want be what you want

mission to scam\nIn the den my friends MNO productions\nFrom the youth's minds that already been corrupted\nWhat's up then Casper holding aces cuts licks like acid\nMelts all your faces change places\nBig B who that be that be me rated R not PG\nWeekly freak thee geek thee make it hype\nPale to rock well gotta story to tell\nPut your hands up in the air if you feel how I feel\nKeep it real still they don't understand it Just demand it\nBut they don't see kids this is how we planned\nLet me hear you sing\nSometimes the groove is so hard the needle never gonna come of this track\nSometimes it feels so good you can't wait for it to come back\nSometimes shit gets buck it don't matter what you do\nMost of the time we don't give a fuck but then again tell me really do you?\n\n", "album": {"title": "ForThemAsses_(2004)&&854", "genre": "Ska Punk", "year": 2004}}]
