every little scar\n\nAt times the self seems in transition\nA mere projection on a screen\nBut what happens when you turn the lights on\nAnd things are not as they once seemed?\n\nShed your skin\nCast off your chains\nFeel the sun upon your face for once\nAnd wash away the pain\nShed your skin\nBe who you are\nUnencumbered by the weight\nOf hiding every little scar\n\nWho we are is always changing\nA never-ending course of growth\nBut deep inside there is a pillar\nDeep inside there is a soul\n\nShed your skin\nCast off your chains\nFeel the sun upon your face for once\nAnd wash away the pain\nShed your skin\nBe who you are\nUnencumbered by the weight\nOf hiding every little scar\n\n", "album": {"title": "Storm_(2004)&&4662", "genre": "EBM", "year": 2004}}, {"title": "Infinite",

of drifting backwards standing still\nSo throw the towel in, if you must\nGive up hope and give up trust\nAnd I promise you'll drift backwards standing still\n\nSomething changed in you when you gave up\nWhen you decided that you had tried enough\nThe price was too much\n\nThe inconsistencies seemed plain to see\nA swift departure from reality\nHow blind can you be?\n\nSweet denial, take your leave\nYou must have others to deceive\nI'm so tired of drifting backwards standing still\nSo throw the towel in, if you must\nGive up hope and give up trust\nAnd I promise you'll drift backwards standing still\n\nSung to sleep by sycophantic choirs\nYou preferred the company of liars\nWho made you feel admired\n\nBut one by one they turned their backs on you\nThe ranks of your detractors grew and grew\nWhen they learned the truth\n\nSweet denial, take your leave\nYou must have others to deceive\nI'm so tired of drifting backwards standing still\nSo throw the towel in, if you must\nGive up
