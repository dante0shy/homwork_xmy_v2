deliver, make you shiver and shake\nI put that on the state, I stand tall as a gate\nMoving till I checkmate, cause the game is a trip\nYou get tossed up and flipped, niggaz'll sink your ship\nNow you script air tight, I'm a freestyle king\nWe could take it to the ring, while I slaughter the scene\n'99's the year, and I want the whole rock\nFrom the bottom to the top, we gon set up shop\nAnd the

maid\nThat cook food like a old school, ghetto slave\nThis is a ghetto love, ghetto pain\nThis is ghetto game, a ghetto brain\nAnd I won't get paid, won't delay\nUntil I show y'all, just what the ghetto made\nI got a ghetto name, with ghetto fame\nAnd I could not ever, be ghetto shame\nI put the ghetto blame, on ghetto knee\nI put the ghetto in your face, so your eyes could see\n\nSpit spectacular, Southside benacular\nWho bleed blocks, like Dracula\nThat flip do' like spatulas, playa we ain't amateurs\nDope characters, that's bigger than life\nThe bigger the slice, the bigger the ice\nThe bigger the better, the home of trend setters\nYou know the letters, T-E-X-A\nS-D's, 33rd streets don't rest ok\nWe just fabulous, too ghetto fabulous\nBut these fakers back, stabbing us\nMan the Shop, ain't slacking up\nSee the paper keeps stacking up\nWe in the ghetto, still acting up\nMama ain't no Shaqing up, I'm chasing ghetto bucks\nIn the ghetto hush, but we could do our thug thang\nBut you can do the scrub thang, this ain't no kiss or hug thang\n\n", "album": {"title": "Da_Sky%27s_Da_Limit_(2002)&&3572", "genre": "Southern Hip Hop", "year": 2002}}, {"title": "That's All
