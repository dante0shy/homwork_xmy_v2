background \"Happy New Year!\")\nShe was a night owl\nAnd had 'em like a high school drop out\nHer brittle bones were cracking faintly\nHer ode to was a lunch time lady\n\nSo I can turn back honey, come on back darling\nCome on, come on, get back together\nWaste your time in the new when I am talking to you\nShut up\n\nShe was cooling up from every thing we ever taught her\nHe said only try to talk when spoken to and believe it's now or never\n\nSo I can go back honey, You're folding money\nCome on, come on get back together\nPrance around in the nude when I am talking to you, shut up\nTurn your self in to mush, you're taking it off\nCome on get back together\nWaste your time in the new when I am talking to you come on\n\nLike a tiger creeping, oh Canada\nYou dug your teeth in\nAnd this child is gonna walk himself home and nothing is gonna stop his progress\nSo I can turn back honey, come on back darling, come on, come on get back together\nPrance around in the nude when I am talking to you so shut up\nTurn your self in to mush, you're taking it off\nCome on get back together\nWaste your time in the new when I am talking to you, shut up\n\n", "album": {"title":
