insides with dehydrants, a black lung, an ignition key\nAnother night accelerates to stop and stay the same\nAnother 16 hours down the drain\n\nWaking up, coughing up, hardened throats and blackened lungs\nIt's easy to stop stopping anytime you want\nGrowing pains from growing old, fingertips burn from the cold\nBlood and oxygen, another evening killing friends\n\nWill I wake up tomorrow?\nWill it be another replay of today?\nDown the drain and out the door\nWhen too much begs for more\n\n", "album": {"title": "Ghost_Stories_(2000)&&2533", "genre": "Punk Rock", "year": 2000}}, {"title":
