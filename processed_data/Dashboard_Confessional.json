together\nQuiet in the grasp of dusk and summer\n\nBut you've already lost\nBut you've already lost\nBut you've already lost\nWhen you only had barely enough to hang on\n\nAnd she combed your hair and she kissed your teeth\nAnd she made you better than you'd been before\nShe told you bad things\nYou wished you could change in the lazy summer\n\nAnd she told you, laughing down to her core\nSo she would not cry as she lay in your lap\nShe said, \"Nobody here can live forever\nQuiet in the grasp of dusk and summer\"\n\nBut you've already lost\nBut you've already lost\nBut you've already lost\nWhen you only had barely enough to hang on\n\nShe said, \"No one is alone the way you are alone\"\nAnd you held her looser than you would have\nIf you ever could have known\nSome things tie your life together, slender threads\nAnd things to treasure days like that should last and last and last\n\nBut you've already lost\nBut you've already lost\nBut you've already lost\nWhen you only had
