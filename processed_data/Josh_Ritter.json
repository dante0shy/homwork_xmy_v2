song\nSoft and low\n\nSo, living on the edge of the city limit line\nThis is where the boundary finally ends\nAnd I swear that we're the last living souls\nIn a populated ghost town\nAll the billboards are our best friends\n\nOh, which way did our last chance go and can we\nGet out if we go right now?\n'Cause it seems that with the malls\nAnd the mega-church stadiums\nWe would get out if we knew just how\n\nWith the radio on\nAll singing a country song\nSoft and low\n\nOh, when I've got a worried mind I know\nI hear the ghost of Patsy Cline\nOn the Grand Ole Opry Show\n\nStanding in line to get my self-help book signed off\nOn by the reverend who shouts to the converted\nHave mercy on this boy\nHe did it all by the book\nBut still kind of has his doubts\n\nYeah you look pretty good in that jonquil dress\nBut your smile is a wooden nickel's pride\nAnd I know that it ain't worth much\nIt feels good to touch\nAnd I think that I could dance if I tried\n\nWith your radio on\nAll singing a country song\nSoft and low\n\nOh, when I've got a worried mind I know\nI hear the ghost of Patsy Cline\nOn the Grand Ole Opry Show\n\n", "album": {"title":

saw some people\nAt last we saw some people\nAt last we saw some people huddled up against\nRain that was descending like railroad spikes and hammers\nThey were headed for the border\nWalking and then

"artist": {"unique_name": "Josh_Ritter"}, "lyrics": "I became a thin blue flame\nPolished on a mountain range\nAnd over hills and fields I flew\nWrapped up in a royal blue\nI flew over Royal City last night\nBullfighter on the horns of a new moon light\nCaesar's ghost I saw the war-time tides\nThe prince of Denmark's father still and quiet\nThe whole world was looking to get drowned\nTrees were a fist shaking themselves at the clouds\nI looked over curtains - it was then that I knew\nThat only a full house gonna make it through\n\nI became a thin blue wire\nThat held the world above the fire\nAnd so it was I saw behind\nHeaven's just a thin blue line\nIf God's up there he's in a cold dark room\nThe heavenly host are just the cold dark moons\nHe bent down and made the world in seven days\nAnd ever since he's been a-walking away\nMixing with nitrogen in lonely holes\nWhere neither seraphim or raindrops go\nI see an old man wandering the halls alone\nBut only a full house gonna make a home\n\nAnd I became a thin blue stream\nThe smoke between asleep and dreams\nAnd in that clear blue undertow\nSaw Royal City far below\nBorders soft with refugees\nStreets a-swimming with amputees\nIt's a Bible or a bullet they put over your heart\nIt's getting harder and harder to tell them apart\nThe days are nights and the nights are long\nBeating hearts blossom into walking bombs\nAnd those still looking in the clear blue sky for a sign\nGet missiles from so high they might as well be divine\nAnd now the dogs are howling at your door\nSinging 'bout vengeance like it's the joy of the Lord\nBringing justice to the enemies not the other way round\nThey're guilty where killed and they're killed where they're found\nIf what's loosed on earth will be loosed up on high\nIt's a Hell of a Heaven we must go to when we die\nWhere even Laurel begs Hardy for vengeance please\nThe fat man's crying on his hands and his knees\nBack in the peacetime he caught roses on the stage\nNow he twists indecision, takes bourbon for rage\nLead pellets peppering aluminium\nHalcyon, laudanum and opium\nSings kiss thee Hardy this poisoned cup\nHis winding sheet is busy winding up\nIn darkness he looks for the lights that've died\nYou need faith for the same reasons that it's so hard to find\nAnd this whole thing is headed for a terrible wreck\nAnd like good tragedy that's what we expect\n\nAt night I make plans for a city laid down\nThe hips of a girl on the spring-covered ground\nSpirals and capitals in the twists of a script\nStreets named for heroes that could almost exist\nFruit trees from Eden and the gardens that seem\nTo float like the smoke from a lithium dream\nCedar trees growing in the cool of the squares\nYoung women walking in the portals of prayer\nThe future glass buildings and the past an address\nThe weddings in pollen and the wine bottomless\nAnd all wrongs forgotten and all vengeance made right\nThe suffering verbs put to sleep in the night\nThe future descending like a bright chandelier\nThe world just beginning and the guests in good cheer\nIn Royal City I fell into a trance\n'Cause it's hell to believe there ain't a hell of a chance\n\nI woke beneath a clear blue sky\nThe sun a shout, the breeze a sigh\nThe old home town and the streets I knew\nWrapped up in a royal blue\nI heard my friends laughing out across the fields\nThe girls in the gloaming and the birds on the wheel\nThe raw smell of horses and the warm smell of hay\nCicadas electric in the heat of the day\nA run of Three Sisters and the flush of the land\nAnd the lake was a diamond in the valley's hand\nThe straight of the highway and the scattered-out hearts\nThey were coming together, they were pulling apart\nAnd angels everywhere were in that midst\nIn the ones that I loved, in the ones that I kissed\nI wondered what it was I'd been looking for above\nHeaven's so big there ain't no need to look up\nSo I stopped looking for royal cities in the air\nOnly a full house gonna have a prayer\n\nOnly a full house\nOnly a full house\n\n", "album": {"title": "The_Animal_Years_(2006)&&6562", "genre": "Folk", "year": 2006}}, {"title": "Monster

know that it was home till you up and left\n\nCome and find me now\n\nI keep you in a flower vase\nWith your fatalism and your crooked face\nWith the daisies and the violet brocades\nAnd I keep me in

box made out of myrtle lay the bone of song\nThe bone of song was a jawbone old and bruised\nAnd worn out in the service of the muse\nAnd along its sides and teeth were written words\nI ran my palm along them and I heard\nLucky are you who finds me in the wilderness\nI am the only unquiet ghost that does not seek rest\nThe words on the bone of song were close and small\nAnd though their tongues were dead I found I knew them all\nIn the hieroglyphs of quills and quatrain lines\nOsiris-the fall of Troy-Auld Lang Syne\nKathleen Mauvoreen-Magnificat-Your Cheatin' Heart\nThe chords of a covenant king singing for the Ark\nThen I saw on a white space that was left\nA blessing written older than the rest\nIt said leave me here I care not for wealth or fame\nI'll remember your song - but I'll forget your name\nThe words that I sang blew off like the leaves in the wind\nAnd perched like birds in the branches before landing on the bone again\nThen the bone was quiet it said no more to me\nSo I wrapped it in the ribbons of a sycamore tree\nAnd as night had come I turned around and headed home\nWith a lightness in my step and a song in my bones\nLucky are you who finds me in the wilderness\nI am the only unquiet ghost that does not seek rest\n\n", "album": {"title": "Hello_Starling_(2003)&&2612", "genre": "Folk", "year": 2003}}, {"title": "You Don't Make it Easy Babe",
