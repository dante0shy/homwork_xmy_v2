1,"Girl you know, you can't go on this way
Night after night, day after every day
Whisper to me, what's in your aching heart
This love you need is not very far
Baby dry the tears from your eyes
And take my hand as we walk into the night

A soul on fire and a touch that's cold
Seems to me that's all you've ever known
Desperately looking for something that's real
Hard to find is the love that can heal
Baby dry the tears from your eyes
And take my hand as we walk into the night
Tender are the dreams
That we try so hard to hide, so deep inside

I don't know why you go on this way
Night after night, and about every day
Tell to me, the secrets only a girl could know
How much to feel and just how much to show
Baby dry the tears from your eyes
And take my hand as we walk into the night

2,"Can you take this broken boy
And put the pieces back as one?
Though he has all of his toys
He is never having fun

Because it's not enough
Now we're growing up
We're giving up
We're moving on
Because it's not enough
We were growing up
We ain't giving up
And I won't hear what you say so

Save your sympathy
Who d'you think you're fooling
Everything is dead
Now you welcome me to a town called hypocrisy
Save your sympathy
Who d'you think you're fooling
Everything is dead
Now you welcome me to a town called hypocrisy

Can you take this lonely girl
And pick her up from off the ground?
'Cause there's no pride to be found
When you follow sheep around
And no future here, no future for us in this town

Because it's not enough
Now we're growing up
We're giving up
We're moving on
Because it's not enough
We were growing up
We ain't giving up
And I won't hear what you say so

Save your sympathy
Who d'you think you're fooling
Everything is dead
Now you welcome me to a town called hypocrisy
Save your sympathy
Who d'you think you're fooling
Everything is dead
Now you welcome me to a town called hypocrisy

La la la lalalala

Because it's not enough
Now we're growing up
We're giving up
We're moving on
Because it's not enough
We were growing up
We ain't giving up
And I won't hear what you say so

Save your sympathy
Who d'you think you're fooling
Everything is dead
Now you welcome me to a town called hypocrisy
Save your sympathy
Who d'you think you're fooling
Everything is dead
Now you welcome me to a town called hypocrisy

3,"There's a sense of longing in me
As I read Rosemary's letter
Her writing's honest
Can't forget the years she's

Lost
In isolation
She talks about her love
And as I read
""I'll die alone""
I know she's aching

There's a certain detail seen here
The pen must have slipped to the side
And left a stain
Next to his name
She
Knows he's gone

And isolation
Is all that would remain
""The wound in me
Is pouring out to rest
On a lover's shore""

5,"And it came again, like tears for a long lost friend
Tears that find their rest
Amidst words too sordid to comprehend

And it came bearing gifts
Of pain, frankincense, and her
None had a home here, none but the pain

Feel the fervor growing but the hate is stronger
My heart was whole with you
But the pain was mine, come twisted flowers
Come blistered soul, torturing disdain
And the wholeness that is only found in you
Feel the fervor growing but the hate is stronger
My heart was whole with you
But the pain was mine

And it came bearing gifts
Of pain, frankincense, and her
None had a home here, none but the pain

And it left once, alone amidst my words I stood
Uninviting of its presence, this time it's left for good
Feel the fervor growing but the hate is stronger
My heart was whole with you

But the pain was mine, come twisted flowers
Come blistered soul, torturing disdain

And the wholeness that is only found in you
Feel the fervor growing but the hate is stronger
My heart was whole with you
But the pain was mine
And when it's gone forever, a better hand is dealt
And when it's left forever, only then can I find myself

6,"To all the rest who have a mother and father
Who have given them a home and a name
Would check before you walk away like you don't need them
'Cause some of us would kill just to have them for a day

Well mom and dad I only wish that you could see me
Following in the footsteps of the man who started it all

'Cause I'm fine (fine)
Livin' on the bed sheets
Holding on to all that's mine
Home just hasn't yet arrived

Said I'm fine (fine)
Livin' in the back streets
Holding on to all that's mine
Home just hasn't yet arrived
For me

So there's this boy who has all the answers
But I say that I don't need them
'Cause I can find my happiness
Close to my heart

And along the way in a different world
Of a different time of a different man
You would come into the better years
The best years of your life

'Cause I'm fine (fine)
Livin' on the bed sheets
Holding on to all that's mine
Home just hasn't yet arrived

Said I'm fine (fine)
Livin' in the back streets
Holding on to all that's mine
Home just hasn't yet arrived
For me

Well
We might lead in a different world of a different time (a different time)
But all that matters is that I'm alive
Yeah I'm alive

So I'm fine, so fine
Said I'm fine, so fine, yeah I'm fine

'Cause I'm fine (fine)
Livin' in the back streets
Holding on to all that's mine
Home just hasn't yet arrived

Livin' in the back streets
Holding on to all that's mine
Livin' in the back streets
Holding on to all that's mine

Just living on the bed sheets
Come and find yourself a piece of mind
I don't understand the things that you do
To me

To all the rest who have a mother and father

7,"Drove downtown in the rain, 9:30 on a Tuesday night
Just to check out the late-night record shop
Call it impulsive, call it compulsive, call it insane
But when I'm surrounded I just can't stop

It's a matter of instinct, it's a matter of conditioning, a matter of fact
You can call me Pavlov's dog
Ring a bell and I'll salivate, now how'd you like that?
Dr. Landy, tell me you're not just a pedagogue

'Cause right now I'm lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did
Well, I-I'm lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did, whoa

So I'm a-lying here just staring at the ceiling tiles
And I'm thinking about, oh, what to think about
Just listening and relistening to Smiley Smile
And I'm wondering if this is some kind of creative drought

Because I'm lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did
Well, I-I'm lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did, whoa

And if you want to find me, I'll be out in the sandbox
Just wondering where the hell all the love is gone
A-playing my guitar and building castles in the sun, whoa, whoa, whoa
And singing ""Fun, Fun, Fun""

I'm lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did
Well, I-I'm lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did, whoa

I had a dream
That I was 300 pounds
And though I was very heavy
I floated till I couldn't see the ground
I floated till I couldn't see the ground, oh
Somebody help me, I couldn't see the ground
Somebody help me, I couldn't see the ground
Somebody help me
Because I'm

Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did
Well, I-I'm lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did, ooh, yeah

Drove downtown in the rain, 9:30 on a Tuesday night
Just to check out the late-night record shop (late-night record shop)
Call it impulsive, you can call it compulsive, you can call it insane, oh

8,"Corporal Clegg had a wooden leg
He won it in the war
In nineteen forty-four

Corporal Clegg had a medal too
In orange, red and blue
He found it in the zoo

Dear oh dear, oh are they really sad for me?
Dear oh dear, oh will they really laugh at me?

Missus Clegg, you must be proud of him
Missus Clegg, another drop of gin?
Corporal Clegg, umbrella in the rain
He's never been the same
No one is to blame

Corporal Clegg received his medal in a dream
From her Majesty, the Queen
His boots were very clean
Missus Clegg, you must be proud of him

9,"(*Talking*)
Yeah (yeah), H-A-dub-K (H-A-dub-K)
The Hardest Pit in the Litter, they been waiting on this here
Broke niggaz, get somewhere, cash rules
Everything around us, understand me, what

(Big Pokey)
Cash rules everything around me, I'm a grimy nigga
Patience is a virtue, I call it timing nigga
I get 4 G's around me, 14 for criming
On the phone my dope is ice, I'm 14 and diming
I'm on ladder stairs climbing, fatigue ain't nothing but army clothes
I know my win right, I gotta keep grinding
As long as my figgas is climbing, I'm bout my pay-day
I get mine wrapped, either the yay-way or the AK-way dog
I'm a hood nigga, I'm getting it how I live and
Pay my ties, so I get it back how I give
Now they wanna hound me, majors wanna sign me
Niggaz say they love me, but I think they wanna down me
Y'all know where to find me, swimming in money
Cinnamon honey 600's, linen and honeys
I got mo' raps than mummies, I'm trying to get a car bar
I got mines for sale, who wanna bar raw

Cash rules everything around me
Deep in the slums of the South, is where you'll find me
Use to try to clown me, didn't hang around me
Now that I'm rich, all these hoes wanna hound me

(H.A.W.K.)
Cash rule everything, from lump sums to petty change
From who-do's with bang, to big rims on a Range
I'm true to this game, like Michael Jordan is the hangs
I will do anything, to satisfy my hunger pain
Now way back in the game, nobody gave H.A.W.K. props
Rolled around in drop tops, and pass me up at the bus stop
Now thanks to hip-hop, I'm in a drop top playing hop scotch
I hit a switch and the trunk pops, and bleed y'all day block
For Fat Pat I won't stop, until the world body rocks
And retail shops and mom and pop's, all H.A.W.K. is sold out
For all those who had doubts, look how I turned out
On Yokohamas I burn out, know what I'm tal'n bout
Getting cash is in me, I'm trying to get that Bentley
I want quarters nickels dimes, and I'll even take pennies
Now they green with envy, and I want 'em all to know
Money over everything, even that busted hoe

(Lyrical 187)
Strapped with heat, to knock the dragon off his feet
Take his iron, burn my name up in the streets
90 days 3-65, the grind don't never stop
Niggaz still out here hustling, niggaz still bleed the block
Can't quit we stay paid, kids gotta eat daily
Circle through big figgas, skeet me up the highways
Y'all said I'd never make it, I stay put it on your grave
Till I die I'm making feddy, trying to fill up a plate
With a home on the range, in the hills of Spain
Naked hoes rolling doja, while I'm holding a range
Never change, I remain to stay ready for whatever
Got a brand on my chest, that's gon be with me forever
Get paid, that's how I was brought up
Never knew how to do nothing else, so I guess I'm just stuck
In the slums in the Dirty South, trying to be a ghetto superstar
Want the big macs and Bentley cars, still in the hood
Still put it down, still don't bar

10,"Ladies and gentlemen lights are going out let's step outside and watch the city sleep
Listen and remember wait another day we are explorers far away from home
Stay for just a moment watch the natives dance be civilized and kiss the pretty bride
Brothers and sisters the pain is gone for now let's burn our books and find a little peace
Sooner or later we walk another day we are colliders everywhere we go
Stay for just a car-crash know your heart is weak be primitive and wave your love goodbye
Ladies and gentlemen lights are going out let's step outside and watch the city sleep

Preachers and sinners we are all the same let's save ourselves and drink from deeper wells
Hatred and compassion wail against the walls we are invaders trying to escape
Fight for just a lifetime count the moments lost be so alive and cry as time goes by
Ladies and gentlemen lights are going out let's step outside and watch the city sleep

Greater than the sun
We are greater than the sun

11,"Symbolized. patronized and then tossed out dry
Revolution or humiliation
Promise the bread. the wine, a life that always shines
If only they vote in the proper direction
Pick them up from the floor to get knocked down again
When you're bored with your mission and a new one begins

Ride your new thrill
Smug it suits you well
God in your new science lab
Master of your new promised land

Pick them up from the floor to get knocked down again
When you're bored with your mission and a new one begins

Echo, care and fake some tears to show your opponent
Throwing bones with bread and circus to disguise the proof
You only empower yourself when those in need become
Your new test subjects in your smear campaign, 101

Recycle control from their hands to your own
Every word is dropping empty
Recycle control from their hands to your own
Every word is dropping empty

Promise again
Focus away
From day to day
For your own ends
Their means are dying

Shame the act is old
Count your saintly sermon cells
Angel for your own rewards
Bring the mercy merchants down

Pick them up from the floor to get knocked down again
When you're bored with your mission and a new one begins
Pick them up from the floor to get knocked down again
When you're bored with your mission and a new one begins

12,"(Kool Keith)
There's more whack shit than a lil' bit
Motherfuckin football players tryin' to rhyme
Basketball niggaz, fuck the rap game, don't waste your time
Stay off the court, get off the fuckin' football field
My rap shit is real, ABC News got you gassed up
Fucked up from the mouth up
Pushin assets, Bentleys and houses
Take off your jerseys, grab the mics
Shut the fuck up, flow for flow
Show for show, bitch go for go
Them everyday motherfuckers you listen to, won't help you
When motherfuckers rippin you, from asscrack to ankles
When I'm dissin you, hold the toilet bowl I'm pissin too
Make your white Persian rugs turn yellow - HELLO!
You fucked up with a commercial-ass nigga, soft as Jello
You motherfuckers head back to gas, somethin' more mellow
Shit on your telephones and change your zip code zones
Reptile alien motherfuckers, gorillas comin' toward me
I shit on you clones, and defecate twice in your ice cream cones
Let a Mexican tell you
Why did you try to embarrass yourself and rap against, Kool Keith homes?
Take your basketballs and stick it up your ASS
Take your footballs and stick it up yo' ASS
I battle 27 teams, all the way to New York for 5 hours first class
Give your whack-ass friends a enema
Your girlfriends witness my shit, with a buddy pass
I concentrate, break down motherfuckers fast
G-string niggaz, cover your ass
Dumb ass bitches be quiet - my boyfriend's all that
He's 245 pounds worth of muscle, he can rap fast
Happy New Year bitch! Kiss my ASS
You know the kid, I'm Bill BLASS
Fuck around, you got the GAS
All you motherfuckers comin' out here for the awards and shit
Fuckin' go back home

13,"She's the song that you tried to sing
And the note that you couldn't hit
So you locked her up in a music box
Turn the key on all of us
She spins silver strings in the dark
With melody that ring in her heart
When the cover drops
The world just fades

Away, away, away from her
Waiting and waiting and waiting for her
To say it
K-I-S-S out on this street, I need someone to spell it out
You know our love's not unconditional

A book of matches and a cigarette
A love note that you never sent
You can fold it up
But you won't forget
You can strike a match
But it still might not light

Now I'm the one that's stuck inside
The silver cage
The bird that can't fly away
Clip its wings
If it sings of

The way, the way, the way that it hurt
Waiting and waiting and waiting for her
To say it
K-I-S-S (out on this street) I need someone to spell it out
You know our love's not unconditional
K-I-S-S (out on this street) there's nothing left to talk about
You know our love's not unconditional

F-I-D-E-L-I-T-Y
You are (why) the song turned out this way
Can't you hear me when I say:
""You're in my heart
In my hands
'Round my neck""

We move like a carousel
Streak lights and mirrors in our eyes
It's time to let this go
Can't stop spinning

Around, around, around...
You know our love's not unconditional
K-I-S-S (out on this street) I need someone to spell it out
You know our love's not unconditional

14,"Well, I've got a will but I want yours
I've got a growing heap of crosses and burdens
I've simply lost heart to shoulder
Simply no strength to lift
I've always been a man in need
'Cause I keep stepping in and out of the shadow

Caught by the drift and pitch of whatever it is
That keeps me coming back
I want out
'Cause I'm getting sick
Sick from all this swerving
Driver, sick from turning on you

Someone show me a hole in this cycle
Show me the way away and I'm coming back
The way I came
No! I've seen this place before
Surely this is no place for the light of this world

Oh how sweet the sound
I know it saved but is it changing a wretch like me
Oh my God how sweet is the sound
I once was blind but now I just look away

Stepping in and out of the shadow
Stepping in and out
I just look away

My bride, I don't want to know what I'd be without
Forgiveness brushing these adulterous lips

How come, how come

I twisted you over and under to take you
The coals went so wild as they swallowed the rest
I twisted you under and under to break you
I just couldn't breathe with your throne on my chest

All night, all I hear, all I hear's your heart
How come, how come

So far under the bed
Into the beams you've gone
I've gone, you've gone

I'm wrapped in the depths of these deeds that have made me
I can't bring a sound from my head though I try
I can't seem to find my way up from the basement
A demon holds my place on earth till I die

All night, all I hear, all I hear's your heart
How come, how come

So far under the bed
Into the beams you've gone
I've gone, you've gone

All night, all I hear, all I hear's your heart

The soul and the spillage
The cup that runneth over
Return of the ogre

Close your eyes and see
When there ain't no light
All you'll ever be
Come on save the night
'Cause I don't believe
When the morning comes, it doesn't
Seem to say an awful lot to me

Watch the clouds sift through the aero

Of all the things so bittersweet
You're the first thing I see in morning and in sleep
And you'll be in my arms again
There's no need to cry

Years have been lost but can never be replaced
But my thoughts are with you
Tied to that interstate
And you'll be in my arms tonight

Every criminal mug be, living in luxury, what the fuck G?
That must be Bugsy, in the black tux over there with Lucky
Bring my heater, niggaz might try to slug me
Take me out in back of the club and buck me, and touch me
I felt a hand tug me then turnin' around I peeped the lovely
Fly face, fat ass gave me a glass of bubbly, said,
""Compliments of Bugsy,"" then took me across the persian rug to plug me
He shook my hand and hugged me; thought he would do me ugly
But he dug me, pockets chubby said, ""Nino where them drugs be?""
Over there by the derby, buy they dirty devils from me
To keep my paper sturdy, yo word G
I ain't afraid to get my hands dirty, you heard me?
I be D and fuck all that living thirsty, so Nino
Do his out in Jersey, showin no mercy, with Frank Nitty
Who else and, some nigga with a Babyface that they called Nelson
Bad for your health, Machine Gun Kell' and your Dillinger
Death messenger, known to carry the six cylinder
Look for my army, fatigues to Giorgio Armani's
Holdin' the Tommy, no one can harm me; Will and Tommy
Tried to alarm me and quote, he turned to smoked salami
Dead as a motherfuckin zombie, full of my ammo
With Bugs Mirando, against the grain so, gotta send him
Over the rainbow, he must be brain slow, caught him down
At the train po' in Santo Domingo, left him for dead
Two bullets in his Tango, like how that movie Shane go
Frank Costello, hostile fellow, he murders while remainin mellow
But most of the niggaz on his team was yellow
Cold blooded veins flowin with red Jell-o
There's Joe Adonis, had mad dramas, won't hesitate
To put you in pajamas, fly hooker fine as the Pocahontas
Beauty queen you'll wanta pok-her-hiendas
Frank broke a promise between the organized crimers and old timers
Costello gotta go six below, nobody voted no
To veto, so they hit him with a hollow torpedo
Up in his torso, he ain't a boss so, he can go
Without ever lettin the whole police force know
Lex Diamond was scheamin on Capone's scroll
Wanted to own his whole zone, it leaked out
They shot him at a pay phone
With the big chrome, his whole wig blown
Blood flowin from out his flesh and bones
At the wake at the funeral home it's havoc
Family got hit up with automatics
Non-stop static inside the rackets
Jack McGern was burnin split Joe Adonis cabbage
The underworld was goin' savage
Pretty Boy Floyd was non-void, unemployed, he destroyed shit
With the Infamous click, wasn't to be toyed with
Mad jealous of all the liquor sellers
Shinin with wine cellars, turn 'em from hood dwellers to Goodfellas
Me and Nitty was like bank tellers, nothin' niggaz could tell us
We drove all over, I pushed a shiny yellow Testarossa
Moved on it closer get the toaster
Started to feel like death was closer, I hit Capone hard
Murder him and his bodyguard in they car and dust the chaffeur
Beef over, I blew him like a supernova
Niggaz nicknamed me, The Black Cobra
The Lady Casanova, yo I'm even deadly when I'm sober
Act like you got a chip on your shoulder
And blast the two right through your boulder
Money you didn't know they shoulda told ya
Nigga you fuckin' with a soldier, wake up and smell the Folgers
Niggaz out here done lie in piss to cover up the odor
Operations from here to Minnesota to Dakota
But yo here comes Greasy Thumbs, who wants to get the easy funds
He whispered in my eardrum
""Let's take over the entire city, and split the dough
Me you and Frank Nitty and Siegel and that'll make the bank pretty""
No doubt before we go we gotta murder John Torre
Yo get all his territory dough and end the story yo

24,"(Lil' O talking)
Uh, put out the struggle, put out the struggle, for those that hustle
I reminisce when

That's all we had, five on a dime, two on some gas
Couldn't get no hoes 'cause we didn't have no cash
But still we was alive, so still we was glad
Cause that's all we had

(Lil' O)
I remember scoring fifty pack wrapping my rocks and plastic
Slanging this up to dopefiends when times got drastic
Just a young nigga trying to shine and have shit
And turn my chump change into a million like magic
My situation tragic, my pockets was hurting
And player ain't nothing worse than a broke nigga flirting
I can't forget the day, Karen till he pulled up swerving
My mouth, dropped when I seen Corey blunt suburban
I said it got to be a feeling man
To ride on 20's, screens hanging from the ceiling man
Crawling turning hoes heads like a ceiling fan
A youngster wishing he was balling got to feel my pain
But still I said, hold your head nigga
Cause one day you gone shine and roll red nigga
Just keep your business on the low and don't full fled nigga
Real g's, pay they dues, so thank god
For your life and grind to get there fool

(Big Pokey)
I remember 'fore, trust me, no bus fee
Not even a hot dollar to my M-A and me
It ain't no joke g, when a nigga broke see
Seem like nobody know me, so I stay low key
Riding it out, like a O.G.
Mash and put it up, like a nigga told me
By all means, I'ma mash to get it
And I'ma mash for my cash till I mash and hit it
Got to stash to stay with it, keep you a bang
'Fore you make a move, think, stay sharp as a shank
And the room display, we got dues to pay
If we don't live for tomorrow, we gone lose today
Who's to say, that you can't succeed
Set your mind to achieve, with the knowledge you retrieve
Always believe and have faith in the man
Everything will go according to plan, knowI'msaying

(Lil' O)
See when you broke, hoes act funny
That's why most niggas grind hard to stack money
We was skinny niggas, trying to get fat tummies
All I wanted was a cadillac and bad honies
But still a player had to take his time
Cause young niggas go to the penn for trying to shine
I've seen boys get twenty years for slanging dimes
Out here thinking it's a game, boy you out of line
And now you doing time

(Big Pokey)
But I got to grind
And mash for this paper 'cause I got to shine
And watch theses hating ass niggas so I cock the nine
And keep my business on the low, 'cause they drop the dime
And for real nigga I ain't lying, that fast money, shoe box stash money
One way street, cause you really a crash dummy
Cash money, it's M-O-E
And nigga, I'm just glad to be free

You better, check yourself respect yourself
You better go for self because I flow for self

(Verse 1: Faith Evans)
I'll tell you why there's no love, simply you're not cool enough
For what we had between us, don't you know you lost my trust
People ask me where you've been (Where you've been)
And I tell them were just friends (Tell them we're just friends)
'Cause it's so obvious that it's never gonna work for us
No no oh no (No)

Played with my emotions (Played)
You gets no devotion (And you gets no love, gets no love)
You can't get no love from me
You can't even be my friend (Be my friend)
And you gets no love again
Whatever you do it will come back to you bitch
(You gets no love from me)

(Verse 2: Faith Evans)
Tell you why we can't hook up (You gets no love)
'Cause I had about enough (You gets no love)
Hearin all the lies you tell (You gets no love)
Boy I thought I knew you well
People think that you're my man (People think that you're my man)
They don't even understand (They don't even understand)
Just because I let you get some that don't make you the one
We ain't even in love (You know you played with my...)

Played with my emotions You gets no devotion
You gets no love, you can get no love from me
You can't even be my friend (Can't be my friend)
And you gets no love again
Whatever you do it will come back to you bitch

([P.Diddy:] Yo! Faith let 'em know!)
You better, rock my shit don't knock my shit
Because I got the shit that make you cop my shit
I know y'all sick of this Bad Boy diva
That blows and plus got flows ridiculous
You better, rock my shit don't knock my shit
Because I got the shit that make you cop my shit
It's the chick from the bricks that got the hot shit
Left you sick from the single now check the remix
Boy you had a clue, thought we had a cool relationship
But you couldn't handle it (You couldn't handle it)

(Verse 3: G. Dep (P.Diddy))
Yo! At the end of the day what a playa 'gon do? (Badboy)
You got love for me, It's how supposed to be
Same love I'm a land on you (Come on)
Right back at you it's only natural
So what I'm gon' do? Me
Everything love ain't always lovely
Leave it all up to me, I'll be livin' in luxury, sucker free
Without no lies without no ties to those that patronize
That's why I don't socialize
I eat, shit, even sleep with open eyes
Just, give me that gasoline
I'll move in the jag few bags of green
Couple ads in the magazine
All freezy and I'm easy G Deezy one

Played with my emotions, you gets no devotion
Whatever you do it will come back to you bitch
You can't even be my friend, cause you gets no love again
Can't even be my friend, and you gets no love again

You played with my emotions and you gets no devotion
Can't even be my friend, and you gets no love again
You played with my emotions and you gets no devotion
Can't even be my friend, and you gets no love again

Walking alone with no one endless guilt.
Forever we die, time is not hers, not near the beginning
Walking alone broken dreams
Time is at an end which is near the beginning which brings us
Further from the truth and into history's path and what we call
Hope is nothing but a selfish lie and individual suggestions

Strokes of a brush fades away
Strokes of a brush fades away
As the wind blows, as the water hits the sand
Broken memories of a time forgotten,
Some called a dying wish or some called a dying dream, life
To kill!

The day will slowly drown
Walking alone with no none, forever we die, time is not here
Not near the beginning, walking alone broken dreams
The rain falls outside the sky which was once
Now turns black as night

Of every action comes to rest upon your shoulder

Blood and sweat, got a nigga feeling the pain
Moving like a freight train, and ain't looking back
Trying to make the big head stack, feel that
Open your eyes, I'm a wolverine on the rise
Mobbing like Wise Guys, my eyes on the prize
Recognize, it's a hell of a feeling
It's cathedral ceilings, I'm building and shuffling shilling
Trying to touch a million, 'fore my time is up
I ain't touched it yet, so I ain't blind enough
And the playa haters agitated, cause the figgas
I done calculated, I put it in they face laminated
Nonstop, let 'em know my guns chop

Laws come dumping, all the neers gate and jumping nigga
Get my bail on, head home and get my cell phone
So I could re-up, and get my mail on
This ain't the first time, I lost my do'
Or toss my do', as long as I ain't lost my hoe
Can't cry over spilled milk, just jump on my game
And make my gears shift, real swift
I'm a threat, one of the realest you ever met
If I'm trading a set, with a brick and some wet
In the big body Lex on dubs, pop pushed up
Sitting low on the dubs, nigga what

All I need is a three beam, and coffee mug to shake
Big bag of weight, compressed and duct taped
Peep the print on it, K-9 can't get a scent on it
Bust that hoe down, and let the fleas get bent on it
My hustle, I've been known it for deep
Keep my game concrete, cement under my feet
Head up, moving in the right direction
Knowing I can make a mill, with the right connection
Mob Style through Texas, a A-1 selection
And I spit the truth, like a sinner in confession
Hauling wessins, waiting for something to jump
First nigga to bump, will catch a hot one in his gum
Get your paper by all means, gotta survive
Working this crack of construction, from nine to five
But it's my time to shine, I'ma blind they eyes
Knocking my rides off like French fries, supersized

But he knows and sometimes he weeps quietly his heart breaks and breaks
His fire seems to be extinct
That is how they want him to be (but what have you achieved)

Associates are reeling
The wallpaper is peeling
He doesn't see the paperwork that's come unstuck

Please don't get us wrong, man
This is just a song, man
No matter what we say
This is the season
Stormy weather's on the way
This is the season
Stormy weather's on the way
You better start worrying, witchcraft's here to stay

In comes Saville
Had his fill of travel
Grabbed a bite on the flight, just touched down today
Looking drawn and haggard
Through the door he staggered
With a sound that he found over Frisco way

Please don't get us wrong, man
This is just a song, man
No matter what we say
This is the season
Stormy weather's on the way
This is the season
Stormy weather's on the way
You better start worrying, witchcraft's here to stay

36,"Kill!

We see them coming a mile away
Gathered to kill on the desolate plain
No fear in our minds
Pure hate in our hearts

Miscalculation of our strength their bane
Take us lightly and we'll make you pay
Pride left them defenseless
No mercy for hubris

They rush to fight us and we stand and wait
Pulses quicken as they take the bait
Mere seconds to the slaughter
We can wait no longer

Closing fast with their weapons high
Still believing it's we that will die
Now the ambush is sprung
Now they learn that they were wrong
Now the killing will start
Tear the bastards apart

They thought it would be easy but now they're being crushed
Arrogance of power leaves them dying in their blood
There will be no mercy for these filthy sons of whores
The innards of my enemys impaled upon my sword
Many years we've waited for this final day of slaughter
Our victims are decapitated, their limbs are torn asunder
Careful preparation brought our haughty victims down
Our forces are at full strength and the time to kill is now

Time to kill is now
Time to kill is now
Time to kill is now
Time to kill is now
Time to kill is now
Time to kill is now
Time to kill is now

Time to kill!

They are all dead, it's their end today
All lost their lives in tremendous pain
Not one has survived
We left none alive

Do not doubt our conviction to kill
Hate on our side we will never fail
Now the killing will start
Tear the bastards apart
Strike the enemy down
The time to kill is motherfucking now

",4
37,"Rebellion of a drive prince afraid
To turn to ask for help
Even if you could see through my
Falling apart to die why?
And even if you could see through my eyes

This time I will not be denied I'm seeing
A better tomorrow this time
I will not be denied, cry, die
Today forever I will not be denied of this fate

Blind, we are all blind

The sixth demon he pulls his strings
And he will see (me)

Will acceptance, ever except, ever except me
Confirm your blackness, swallow and smile
You've killed me now, swallow and smile

38,"How many times have I noticed that our eyes hardly ever meet
From your judgment seat I can feel the anger for my very being
Fill me in on when you became such a big part of my life
That I should bother with all your lies designed to bring me down
Wrong again, don't depend on any reaction again

I remember the icy walls that shot up from nowhere
And I can see every lie you've ever told yourself
You bleed me dry and I don't ask why, but I'm left with the dust
Judas kiss, I dismiss, thank you all for this, I am untouched (I am)

Wait again, not through with the screaming
I contend that you've got nothing better to do

I'd trade my life for a barrel of gold
Find someone else before I get too old
If I live my life for aesthetic gain
Will you repay me with all your shame

I can see every light inside your brain
Go on every time that I walk by for nods and whispers
Your comfort in my suffering is no longer disturbing
I'm lost beyond your petty stopwatch in life's real time (life's real)

Wait again, not through with the screaming
I contend that you've got nothing better to do

I'd trade my life for a barrel of gold
Find someone else before I get too old
If I live my life for aesthetic gain
Will you repay me with all your shame

Don't get up I was only leaving the room
When the door of your judgment swings back around again
Maybe I'll stop to watch your act and I'll go on my way
I've seen quite enough of too many childish games

I'm ashamed of every moment
That I ever gave them the time of day
All the worst enemies
Are somehow always friends that used to be

Shoot 'em up quick in a minute and within a minute, you already suckas, I bet that you bent it. We sent it. We'll attest for the murder--we should, we dealt it.

Call up the crew, is what you do
Be in my spot, around two
Oh yeah, bring some guns, bring some mac's

We laughed a little, y'all got them things
Okay thanks, now look here's the plan
Hold up, please, whose your man?
Oh him? That's, my man Sharod
Don't worry about him, that's the God
He specializes in gun firin'
Pickin' locks, ditchin' cops
And robberies, goes on, robbin' sprees
He's the, he's the man, here's the plan
Remember the bank, we at before
Well, he headed back to make a withdrawel

Loaded up the gats, while we pullin' up

Anything move, we make it hot
Doors open, we put our masks on
Our gats poked, it won't take that long
Anybody grab me, I whispered softly
Do what you got to do, to get them off me
Hands twitchin', gettin' feelings
Saw the security, might have to kill 'em
Walk through the door, damn it's crowded
Walked on the floor, then shouted
(It's a robbery!) Everybody down
Don't make a move, don't wanna hear a sound
Looked a Sharod, gave me the nod
Let me know, I did my job

Told the teller, feel the bags
Had the mack, pointin' at the glass
Hurry up, you're movin' slow
Time is money and I got to go
Grab the bags, head for the door
Backin' out, clutchin' the dog
We heard sirens, dashed to the ride
And cop we see, open fire
Cop car, swung around the block
My man Rock, opened up the shots
My homey Lace, real nutty case
Said let's get it on, fuck a chase
Women screamin', grabbin' they kids
My homey Lace, flashin' the shit
Laughin' and shit, homey is sick
Look at Sharod, said let's go
Four desperado's, holdin' the dough
Make a left, yo, make a right
Head straight, though, watch those lights
We're in the hideout, laughin' it up
Watchin' the news, about the bank we stuck

They all hang out at Peg Leg Lee's
And they don't give a hoot about no police
Peg Leg Lee's is where I'm talking about
They knocked down, kicked, and dragged 'em out

They get paid on Friday when their work's all done
And they all do it up 'til Monday comes
When they do the Slop they turn loose hands
And move like a chicken when he's scratching in the sand
Shuffle your feet and spin like a top
Shake shake shake the Georgia Slop

I stopped to get a soda and dig that jive
I met a chick, she weighed 385
I started lookin' and I couldn't stop
She and I got together and did the Georgia Slop

Peg Leg Lee's is where I'm talking about
They knocked down, kicked, and dragged 'em out
Do it baby, do it baby, do it baby, do it baby
To the right, to the left
Oh baby, yah do it baby

Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why shouldn't it be true?
I get a kick out of brew

There's only one beer left
Rappers screaming all in our ears like we're deaf
Tempt me, do a number on the label
Eat up all they MC's and drink 'em under the table like
""It's on me, put it on my tab kid""
However you get there, foot it, cab it, Iron Horse it
You're leaving on your face, forfeit
I crush the mic, hold it like the heat, he might toss it
Told him tell they stole it, he told her he lost it
She told him ""Get off it,"" and a bunch other more shit
Getting money, DT's be getting no new leads
It's like he eating watermelon stay spitting seed after seed
It's the weed, give me some of what he's drooping off
Soon as he wake up, choking like it was whooping cough
They group been soft
First hour at the open bar and they're trooping off
He went to go laugh and get some head by the side road
She asked him to autograph her derriere, it read
""To Wide Load, this yard bird taste like fried toad turd, love, villain""
Take pride in code words
Crooked eye mold nerd geek, with a cold heart
Probably still be speaking in rhymes as an old fart
Study how to eat to die, by the pizza guy
No he's not too fly to skeet in a skeezers eye
And squeeze her thigh, maybe give her curves a feel
And the same way she feel it when she flow with nerves of steel
They call the super when they need their back, uh, plumbing fixed
""How there's only one left? the pack comes in six
Whatever happened to two and three?""
A herb tried to slide with four and five and got caught like, ""What you doing G?
Don't make me have to get cutting like truancy
Matter fact not for nothing right now you and me""

Looser than a pair of 'Didas
I hope you brought your spare tweeters
MC's sound like cheerleaders
Rapping and dancing like Red Head Kingpin
DOOM came do the thing again no matter who be blinging
He do it for the smelly hubbies
Seeds know what time it is like it's time for Teletubbies
Few can do it even fewer can sell it
Take it from the dude who wear mask like a tarded helmet

He plots shows like robberies
In and out, one, two, three, no bodies please
Run the cash and you won't get a wet sweatshirt
The mic is the shottie, nobody move, nobody get hurt
Bring heat, like ya boy done gone to war
He came in the door, and everybody on the floor
A whole string of jobs, like we on tour
Every night on the score, coming to your corner store

There, it is done
Now that the representative from South Africa has been mind programmed, all of the world's leaders on earth are under my control
And when they meet tomorrow in special session, I, DOOM, shall be voted master of the world
My plan is foolproof but just in case

And what about snow?

And you keep your eyes open
When I tell ya, start snappin'

I am risking my life to tell you with great concern that I must warn you
I, I, you must listen
Many among you, have, have, have their minds taken over

So WHASSUP? Those that want a beef nigga bring it on
'Cause when I'm done, it'll be my dick that you're swingin' on

To septuplet lady plants
Check my tympanic titanic time pulse
By the grace of the Immortal One
I am the poisonous priest of fifty until the ?m'salaam?
So every naked ape on Earth bow down in silence
To the slumlord, of all universe reality
Ironic supalism sodomizes your mentality
Science super-mystics and futuristics join in wedlock
So my freon cyrogenics make your head rot pop then bust
From galactic cryathallic mechany mal ??

Preposterous, ice in my drop, yeah that's niggaz
When I bend prisms and ride soundwaves in your eutrichula
Malopropism is none, when I cerebrum wash in your brain pan
Mixin ooze, your state of bein and attitude
Petuitary shrinks, accepts it when
I bite then flatten your head
Richencypholic surgeon of my cosmorama, astrophysical
Invades one, individual stands
And uses cosmic radiation as a cosmetic
To beautify inner fantastic, gory flow
So, writing weak rhymes to your boomin system is no mo'

There is something you need to know
Breakin mo' grounds than aftershocks from the earthquakes in San Fran'
More determination than a bull, seein Redman
Imagine, Technic glare +From Where???+
Competition say I gotta be display 'em in a photo album
Disorganized has the other file
Bein flamboyant like ? herbal user, slash, barracuda
With key maneuvers like silent troopers of styles
?? To split your wig and nip your eyebrows
Go to space and greet the stars, huh
Started chewin on the Milky Way, thought it was the candy bar
You get the gong 'cause we niggaz do wrong
And if you're young, and in love, do the moves of Michael Evens
Singin' songs, big up to my peoples Northside
Show the brotherhood, how I recognize

I've been, detonatin equivalyrical exposives
Rambo soldiers deep like the black trials of Moses
Madness and wisdom accelerates my pendulum
No attackin my forces of life, 'cause I got ten of em
Dangerous, disciple killin' images
My warfare dreads be just like Nemesis
Infiltrates, holy massacres like ?tnakarid?
My religion break down prisons for missionaries
In it to survive, so enlist, in strategies
My non-exist thinkin' only lead, to casualties
I'm battlin, invadin, interceptin
Makin' sure don't nuttin move in your section
Don't misinterpret my threats as just talk
And the raise of a hand can make, worlds start haltin

Yo, it's the Mad child layin verses like tile
Niggaz go impotent, when I kick these potent ass freestyles
Wack MC's get mad and look at me hard
'Cause they used to be the shit, like McDonald's on Broad
It's odd, how niggaz try to bomb
Then I be fadin more motherfuckers than AIDS story harvest
Throwin' niggaz away like apple cores - I don't wanna see shit
But some hits and Ed McMahon at my front door
I'm rippin tapes, niggaz still makin' SHIT cakes
Slippin down to fall off dudes tryin' to get they shit straight

Ask Dre, can't nobody hack it, they ill Dre?
You get beheaded with a motherfuckin hatchet
Haste makes waste and taste the bass

And how could I ignore

Shine for You, shine for You

There is no one else
That loves me like You do
There is nothing else
That I would rather do

Reflecting light that comes from knowing

Last forever on love alone

Perhaps it's time you spread your wings

And everything a nigga do may not be what he might say
Chicago nights stay, stay on the mind
But I write many lives and lay on these lines
Wave the signs of the times
Many say the grind's on the mind
Shorties blunted-eyed and everyone wonderin' where I'm
Bush pushing lies, killers immortalized

Waiting for the Lord to rise

To the listeners, here's a movie
I write in black and white, or color
It goes deeper than Warner Bros., or Steven Spielsberg
You can feel the words, I write rhymes you can see
It's not just punch lines, it's a movie, it's a movie

(Sample - during chorus: Master Fool)
For all the land there's Earth

(Killah Priest)
Inside my head, there's an auditorium, with rows of empty chairs
Right above, light bulbs fill the chandeliers
Right below, there's a balcony, that's where I would be
I look again, now there's crowded seats
And an audience surrounding me, the lights go low
And out of nowhere, my notepad glows
Then a motion screen show, my paper becomes a movie screen
Each word is a character that plays a part in the scene
You start to see pictures, but it's only for the listeners
Welcome to the theater

(Killah Priest)
For the admission, all you gotta do is pay attention
My ushers guide you, to where I'll be sitting
It's the intermission, all you gotta do is listen
To get a clear vision, the way I be spitting
The story changes with the rhythms
It comes at you in 3D, it's not just a CD
It's more like DVD (to tape it), I turn radios to TV's
My pen: the projector, and I'm the director
Each line guides my recta, I turn looseleafs to whole movies
Color show is Rudy, a film written by him, rated KP
Bring your lady or your babies, sit through the album
Turn up the volume, stare at the speakers
Till suddenly you're in the bleachers
Lookin' at the main features, viewing the coming attractions
Guns blastin', tons of action

(Killah Priest)
I got love stories that turn gory
From Mafia hits, to politics, follow my lips
Acknowledge my flicks, once I stopped writing, the room brightens
I pick up my pen, then the movie ends
I stop the flow, then the curtains close
The audience stands and leaves the rows
At the same time, another group comes to see the show
I put down my pen, then the movie plays again
It's the vision, what I'm sayin', rewind the time in your mind
Yo, sit back, the seat reclines, you read the credits
A barrage of letters, the ink comes up in cartoons
I'm in a dark room, the words become characters
Actors, with leading roles
I talk from the bullhorn, which is the pen I hold
Capital letters become buildings filled with children
Or merry-go-rounds, lights, cameras, action, the stereo sound
My pen's a wooden puppet, and I'm the ventriliquist
I turn listeners to the vision-ists
My hands written in scripts from Gods to gangstas
To painters, to King Tut, what up?
To entertainers, it's all good, when I write
With this piece of wood, it's a movie

Challengin the God of rap is madness, I'll snatch your status

But I got enough albums to make my OWN top ten!
You limited, like the spread of traffic
You bite my style off the radio

You better Chillout like Chuck, I kick like three Norrises

A dollar bill to us, believe you will trust in that
'Cause if you bust at me, on TV, CD
Internet trust that, I WILL BUST BACK

You need the medicine what I speak is so sick
Then again these veteran be better than many men
Forever we hit 'em again better than ANY trend they could ever say
In any season, hot warm cold or freezin
When it comes to MCin, we believe in rhymin for a different reason

Pushing me to
Respond with violence

Vicious
Cruelty

Maniacal
Psychopath

Slash through the crowd of faces leaving a trail of bloody dead
Hold down the scumbag, slice off his ear, gouge out his fucking eyes

Pounding the human maggots, broken bones cause screams of pain
Femur pokes through the muscles in his upper leg, I wrench it out with force

Stabbing the faces
Knocking out teeth with my nail spiked bat
Internal damage
Trauma from beatings causes organs to burst

Maniacal
Psychopath

Chunks of butchered victims cover the floor in my wake
Frenzied battery and slashing slung pieces of face on the ceilings and walls

Raging violence will consume all of my damaged brain
Ruthless murders are the only way to make this impulse abate

Fifty pound dissector, when I'm buying from Hector
Calls collector, plus a snitch detector
I.Q. like leopard, dope game perfecter
Mobstyle protector, sky street infector
I'm a platinum editor, CEO director
Chin checker, just a certified wrecker
Sweeping up sets, like a Black and Decker
I got Texas ways, it's simply 'cause I'm Texas raised
And handle all animosity, with techs and K's
Split toupees, I stain the brain
Everything gon remain the same, what's my name

(Big Pokey)
Peep the rules, if you snooze you lose
That's why I choose to strap my shoes, and pay my dues
Leave no clues, cause niggaz is fools
Hearts colder than igloos, coolers full of ice
Teelee, 'fore you shoot the dice
Or catch that one way flight, to Paradise
It's nothing nice, if it ain't your time
Keep on if you think I'm lying, it go down
I stay on top of mine, my game
And stains niggaz brains, like mines rain
It ain't mine, if it ain't wide frame
(What if you off the chain), then you best to hide mayn
Spit verses for change, and bring the pain
Rap game John Wayne, (that's a god damn shame)
Infrared for aim, when I rain
This a nigga you can't contain, uncut cocaine

O mercy

Everything I am

Wearin Pele jackets
Fast loot tactics, I'm well up in the millionaire bracket
The boss of all bosses, I own racehorses and a fortress
Corridors with olympic torches and Mona Lisa portraits
Jacuzzis and saunas and eatin steak at Benny Harner's
Bentley's limousine the front yard stream is full of pirahnas
I'm set, a private jet, I drink a lot of Beck's
Get a lot of sess condo and duplex, diamond infested Rolex
Deliver a crown at the world units with silver china
Sippin on finer wine-r you see more shines than diamond miners
The Highness, kingpin of heroin
I'm thorough when I have to bring the terror in
Handle business in each and every borough in
Town or city, I'm rollin' like Frank Nitty, I'm rich and pretty
Back up kiddies, I got crimies that's grimy and gritty
A nigga that's spunky and likes to keep his pockets chunky
Makin' most of my money, from all the dopefiends and junkies
I learned from the best the ones that's livin'
And the ones that's put to rest
So I bless my chest with a vest and pack a Smith-N-Wes
And then I'm off to get the snaps, not the scraps
The game is be a real mack, the name is Kool G Rap

Now it's a damn shame, what I gotta do just to make a dollar
Living in this game, sometimes it makes you wanna holler
It's a damn shame, what I gotta do just to make a dollar
Living in this game, sometimes it makes you wanna holler

I got a fly hoe up under the wing, a swinger that does her thing
And if you step inside my ring, she'll bang it out and make your brains hang
She sits at restaurant tables with mink foxes and sables
Drinkin' Cherenade brand label she'll rock a sucker's cradle
And yeah, honey is more bounce to the ounce
She walks around with lucci in large amounts
Millions inside Swiss bank accounts
Her name is Tammy, got a beach house in Miami
Rides around with a small jammy in her silk and satin panties
A down hoe, a Foxy Brown hoe, standin her ground hoe
And if you clown yo she'll turn into a bust a round hoe
Fly as a Heaven's Angel got sapphires in her bangles
Diamond earrings hangin' dingle gettin' money from all angles
She's pretty under the New York city bright lights
And real light, way after midnight, I hit it cause the slit's tight
Wake up early and make my rounds, break up break down
Packin a silver four pound, some clowns be trying to get down
Light up a smoke and grab a stack of C-notes
Them slick stick up kids don't get no free dough bro
'Cause I ain't tryin' to be broke
I goes all out for G Rap and this honey nothin' funny
It's a damn shame, what I gotta do to get the money

Now it's a damn shame, what I gotta do just to make a dollar

Bigboy, get bagged, he gon' hold my bail
It's like Attica '67 when they, closed the jail
Be careful, but promote yo'selves that's what they told me
Involved but unconcerned fuck beef when it dissolve it does not return
I don't leave, stagnate nor move off-beat
So discrete very rarely do I move on feet
I rough-ride twin rugers on the sides of my seats
Drive-by's, bodies left on both sides of the streets
I blacks out never blind by the size of the image
No disguise, homocide don't rely forensic
Homes's finished, scrambling caught in the scrimmage
12 shells ricocheting and it pours from the hemorrhage
Get the casket embalm and forget the bastard for moving backwards

I'm a hustler, not by choice (4x)

Lazy niggas was sleeping, I was wide awoke
Not a joke, creep on snitches, niggas gotta choke

And I swear it hurts, I supply the coke
'Cause don't nothing scare me worse than dying broke
Iron poking on my ribs while I'm laying in a Taurus
I live this shit y'all just performers, it's a dirty game
I seen thugs turn informers, crooked cops run in the crib, no warrants
Money talk though, never stuck in a grudge,
Got a female lawyer and she fucking the judge
I was once told, that you reap what you sow

Watch us, the way we floss up in coat lockers
Walk right past security, flippin' poppers
Like what? who the fuck gon' stop us?
Y'all wait until the summer, when this fucking album drop us
I know y'all hate it, because y'all flows outdated
You finished as an artist and I finally made it
But I paid my dues, in this game patiently waited

Siedi e ascoltala insieme a me
Ha il profumo di pioggia e di erica
Siedi e ascoltala insieme a me
Lascia che ci porti via

Viene dai pub con i vetri appannati
E i tavoli di legno consumati
Dove se una ragazza intona ""A jug of punch""
Tutti quanti trattengono il respiro
Viene dalle maestose scogliere di Moher
Dai colori degli arcobaleni
Dall'argento e dal blu della Galway Bay
Per venire qui ha fatto molta strada

Percorre le strade dell'America latina
Le favelas dove nasce la rivolta
La ritrovi tra i bimbi della Realidad
O per le vie polverose di Managua
Woody Guthrie l'ha nascosta dentro la chitarra
Victor Jara l'ha cantata chiara e forte
Dappertutto &#232; ricercata dalla polizia
Ma continuano a sentirla per le strade

Dalla brughiera scende una musica

Siedi e ascoltala insieme a me
Lascia che ci porti via

EH - OH CELTICA PATCHANKA
EH - OH CELTICA PATCHANKA

E ancora risuona tra le pietre in Appennino
Sui sentieri dei vecchi partigiani
Tra le foto ingiallite del '43
Sulle troppe promesse fatte a vuoto
Nelle piazze italiane che chiedevano utopia
Libert&#224;, fratellanza e tutto il resto
Sulle fisarmoniche e le batterie
Non finiscono la musica e le storie

Dalla brughiera scende una musica....

Trapped in the heart of it, tryin' to get away
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town
I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down

Got nothing for you, I had nothing before
Don't even have anything for myself anymore

Some people will offer you their hand and some won't

I need something strong to distract my mind
I'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind

I crossed that river just to be where you are
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long

I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free
I've got nothing but affection for all those who sailed with me

Everybody's moving, if they ain't already there
Everybody got to move somewhere
Stick with me baby, stick with me anyhow
Things should start to get interesting right about now

My clothes are wet, tight on my skin
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine

I left Tennessee very much alive
I never would have got through the Arkansas mud
If I hadn't been a-ridin' on the Tennessee stud

I had some trouble with my sweetheart's pa
One of her brothers was a bad outlaw
I sent her a letter by my Uncle Fud
And I rode away on the Tennessee stud

The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud

One day I was ridin' in the beautiful land
And ran smack into an Indian band
They jerked their knives with a whoop and a yell
But I rode away like a bat out of hell

Well I circled their camp for a time or two
And showed what a Tennessee hoss could do
And them redskin boys never got my blood
'Cause I was a-ridin' on the Tennessee stud

The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud

We drifted on down into no man's land
We crossed the river called the Rio Grande
I raced my hoss with the Spaniards bold
Till I got me a skin full of silver and gold

Me and a gambler we couldn't agree
We got in a fight over Tennessee
We jerked our guns, he fell with a thud
And I got away on the Tennessee stud

The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud

Well, I got as lonesome as a man can be
Dreamin' of my girl in Tennessee
The Tennessee stud's green eyes turned blue
'Cause he was a-dneamin' of a sweetheart too

We loped on back across Arkansas
I whipped her brother and I whipped her pa
I found that girl with the golden hair
And she was ridin' on a Tennessee mare

The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud

Stirrup to stirrup and side by side
We crossed the mountains and the valleys wide
We came to Big Muddy and we forded the flood
On the Tennessee mare and the Tennessee stud

Pretty little baby on the cabin floor
Little hoss colt playin' 'round the door
I love the girl with golden hair
And the Tennessee stud loves the Tennessee mare

The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud

Open up to what you find in mari... juana

Everything I need, leave it to the trees

Be rollin' up blunts, and mo' blunts, and mo' blunts
And I, keep a case of swissha sweets in the trunk
So when I'm rollin', smokin', chokin', just floatin'
Through the city in the drop top
Glock cocked, rollin', just rollin'

That's my world, that's my thang

All tangled up like balls of string.
And we woke at dawn
And watched the sun glide over the hill.

I just said the first
Three words that popped into my head.
Let me off the bus; I'm tired and sore and should probably change clothes.
And the circuits are blown,
My woman is cold,
Our children are stoned and worthless.
All waiting for you to tell them the truth. The truth is a line, that you'll never use.

And her dignity
Shown so bright like a light on a hill.
And she burned for me,
And no other man came near the flame.
And back country songs the defeaning twang of the rich-white-kid blues
You can own the stage,
But the lights and glares will not make you real.

She whispers to me, I was meant to be free.
This life that we've built is deadly.
She crawls from my bed, with a comb cross her head.
She crawls to the train and drives herself home

But the answer is identical to how I got this way
No longer am I looking to you
In darkness I have remained
The struggling's a thing of the past
And sometimes I miss the pain
That pain is the evidence I'm fighting for a cause
Every temptation a hurdle I know we can cross
But then I let my guard down and the battle is gone
Complacency takes over so I know something's wrong
Help me, help me find my way
I'm tired, I'm tired of living this way
I need you to bring me back home
Because I, because I hate being alone, all alone

The first time I saw a backwards spun
I was in my living room practisin
Watchin the tube, _Facts of Life_
_Different Strokes_ in the afternoon
_Scarface_ looked mean in the flicks
Everybody who pumped coke back then was fiendin for bricks
'86, no fades, afro tops
In those days your whole ave was the spot
The scene locked with Lee patches, Cazel glasses
Suede Pumas and rumors of rap not lastin
Till the class of '89 came through
High top fade, tailor-made Gucci suits
Jordan was champ, Mike Tyson was amped
Reagan was the pres and the border was a place to camp
Just think back like this

Where we all can go, don't need dough to shine

Rap I master so I teach; each I touch
Respect the power of the microphone in my clutch
Say ma, your little boy's all grown up
Hey y'all, I told you all we got is us

Always focused when I'm reachin' for goals

Let no man take us under, bee
And no bitch for that matter, ya heard me?

(VERSE 3: Tek)
This is for my 18 and under, 20 and over
Walkin' round with the weight of they clothing on they shoulders
Look at me, 26 year old, years enfold
Drive a (?) 'bout a year old
Did the gold, stepped my game up to grade
Rosary throwback, exclusives and haze
Seen hoes and dough come and go
Rememberin the reign of crack and power of dope
Witnessed miracles of babies bein born, niggas bein killed
Niggas gettin' killed, babies born again
Showed your block love, Tekno Marine Breitling
The class of Lockman, new Jacob thing
Benz, 4, 5, 6
Truck, Navigator, Escalade, bitches want dick
Took it from the end of '89 through '99
I'm the nigga 2000 and beyond

(VERSE 4: Sean Price)
Meadowlark Lemon
Wood-sevens on the god neck
They the ghetto park reverends (peace god)
Lee patches got snatched, d's in the hatchback
With ease, nigga, pass that
Bennetton bag (?)
Niggas like, ""Son, you fly"" Yo, I can afford it
Decept niggas, in the party we tangle
With anybody, jump on the train, punch Guardian Angels
Don't believe, we put a stack on it
Cops like, ""You can drink, put a bag on it""
Back in the days...

What's today's mathematics?
Saturday Night Specials, now it's automatics

When crack appeared
VCR's got stole, shorty asses disappeared

Your feeling way too cold
For reasons I don't know
Don't seem to get along

But I'll follow you back home
Not worth it to be alone

It's hard to forget where or who we are
And I can't find where we were

You know you're dragging me down
One day I won't be around
Who will follow you now?
If I could I would find my way out

I wish I could rewind
To the times where you would say
It would never be this way
Now what's on your mind

Do you want me to go or stay?
I'd take black or white over gray

It's hard to forget where or who we are
And I can't find where we were

If I could I would find my way out

And you say I'm backpack, 'cause I don't have a gat
Man I just love life, and I'm dealin' with the facts
I'm young, I'm gifted, I'm beautiful and black

And I, don't need a gun 'cause I'm nice with my hands, c'mon

I wrestle with these words but I'm never gettin' caught up

I gotta lay 'em down on these beats 'cause they need wreck

7-45, is how I hog the road
24/7 nigga, I stay blowed
And all the hoes say H.A.W.K., is thoed
It's the great one, brother of the late one
The straight one, when I bust with this gun
Don't hate son, cause the flow is polish
Never went to college, but still blessed with knowledge
Never had a major deal, and don't even want it
I just flex my skill, and crush my opponent
However you want it, I bring it hard to the rack
And y'all must forgot, I got platinum placks
And that's a fact, the next best thing to crack
To hear one of my songs, you gotta ring it back
Rewind that shit, get off in your mind and shit
The kid is sick, and I love the way he spit

(Lil' Keke)
We spit this rap, and drive this map
Then I kick this flow, and go for mo'
Then I let you niggaz know, that I don't play
Smoke this light green, everyday
I'm on my way, me and my nigga Big Hawk-y
Across the water, alert the Nextel walkie
Young Don, and they just can't see
Another cold nigga, from the 7-1-3

(H.A.W.K.)
Ke hit me on the walkie, so I hit him back
Did you hear what we did, to that Worm track
We did that, boys better back on back
Or I'll react, and dominate just like Shaq
H.A.W.K. and the Don, really we don't barre none
We the shit, and y'all mo'fuckers the runs
Here we come, so y'all better move around
It's the 7-1-3, bout to shut shit down

Lost my way so long ago
And the poison still flows through my veins
But that's alright my baby
Don't look at me that way
Yeah I did not fake it
Don't look at me that way

A circle feels like a direction
I keep spinning round and round
And the engines never seem to cool, yeah

You ain't nobody's fool

Someone tell me, tell me I survived

She says I swear too much
She says a lot of things
Well, I'd swear every other word if I could
For her, I'll make an attempt
Sometimes love isn't about how much someone suits you
But how much you're willing to change to suit them

Two people too damaged too much, too late

One day she said, ""I'm tired""
One day her clothes were on my floor
One day, empty bottles

It doesn't matter 'cause I'm not her man

Rough season

Rough fights...

Yo these funny talking cats tryin' to do a nigga foul

Digital surveillance linked with laptops
Express mail it to me can't ???

So y'all niggas betta get on point

Bad boys watch ya backs

If I was on you, your hoe's and them cowards I'm'll do dirty
Still a commssion and we all equal
All lethal
Caught'em doin' dirt to the wrong people
It's the family affair, I'm here
With all of me I'm'll deal with this one accordingly
Got the locations sittin' in the console pacin'
Get bagged murder be the case and
And I'm tired in jail
Even though through the riots I prevailed
Enjoyin' my freedom, got two kids as long as I feed'em
I'm here for the fam that's there when I need'em

Yo, uh uh uh, hello

One thought I loved her
Seas debate the storm pull him the the surface
That's a purpose
One of these faces, make'em nervous
Catch'em when they out for hamburgers
Turn they whole lunch into a murder
In a way all the rounds gon' be heard of
This shits big, the first thing to catch to where PD is

Just let me know the place we plan to meet
And I'm in it sure as your heart beat

We had a fullproof plan, all we need was the fam
Ammunition, a van, two chicks and one extra man
Two lincoln LS Sedans
Fifteen hundred yards of saran
And after the scam, we be out in Amsterdam
Yo, call Sean in Milan

Mabe Ling and Kim Long

Two rich bitches the feds on

But you know somethin' I have faith in the bad boys
Bad boys bring it on home, bring it on home bad boys

A fugitive lookin' for Puff switchin' my lingo
Stayin' at a hotel called the pink flamingo

Room service bumpin' Kain on the newest song
Holdin' gats knowin' everything I do is wrong
Till I hi-jack the sky flyin' on a unicorn
Downstairs with a bag of money and two clips
Talkin' to Loons chicks wit' sombreros and toothpicks
Sayin' they commit homicides for two bits
And fuck for dough like I give two shits
Wildfire call from Hong Kong
Hello (Loon: Yo Kain I just spotted Sean Jean)
Hold up, some information was missing
I just got the same page from Bris
He told me he saw Sean and two chicks followed by four whips
Somewhere in the Florida sticks

Tell the crew to keep their heads high
I'm gonna flip if any one of my mens die
We've been fucked somebody told us a bent-lie/Bentley (what?)
Let's get back to the spot in NY
Seven glocks P-S-P-O pops

I write this letter
Because my words
Can't be heard

Tears of sorrow
Break this silence
While your soul is flying
A long way from here

Along the shore
Your soul reduced to dust

I'll keep the memories in my heart
And your soul in my mind.
You're leaving here forever
To a place of Avalon.

Along the ocean
The storm reduced
Your soul to ashes

- Today your life is a whisper for the angels
- No please! No! I must find a new way

We spent the last year writing rhymes doing shows and chopping records
And traveled all around the world to spread the message
'Cause ain't no rest for the weary when it comes to my team
We only sleep on December the 32nd
DJ's dissin' the album before they check it
Dealin' with their managers and program directors
And even though I try not to stress it
Sometimes it feels like a waste of time and not worth the effort

(Rapper Big Pooh)
Naw but I won't let it
Put a block on my team's hustle for a second
Poobie keep it rushing, as long as Tay and I on the mic
And 9th is on the percussion, these fronting dudes can't say nothing
It was only time for we finally spoke out
Plenty cold nights ahead I suggest you get your coats out
No time to stand here lips poked out we bout to closeout that stored up doubt
And keep it moving


Seems like whatever I do
It's not enough for you
I paid the cost and gave you my all
But you still want more
I'm still standing right here
But it seems so unfair
That I sacrifice and give you my life
But you still want more

(Phonte)
Been a long time comin'
But damn we just made it
So much to discuss so frustrated
Yes, I must say that the industry lost touch
Radio better play this, 'cause Tay's style is nuts
And y'alls is just dated
Its history in the making
When I write its for all of N.C., call me the state pen
And now I'm making my name for those who hate that I'm
Staking my claim just like Nationwide
Radio, them suckas never play us
Took our wax to the station and they straight played us
That's how the game got contaminated
And now they sayin' we're at fault like the San Andreas

(Rapper Big Pooh)
And still trying to play us
But not spin the record or disc
I got a fire burning deep that will not be extinguished
I mean this from the depths of my soul
People no more mind talk let my heart take control (oh)

- Listen to this, just listen to this
- Uh, right now, we gettin' it right now and now we gonna give you what you want
- Just listen to this, just listen to this
- I'm talking you, you, you, and all of you in the back
And in the middle in the front, come on

(Rapper Big Pooh)
Homie, this here is pain
I'm speaking on this pitiful thing
That's now forever stained in the banks of my memory
You probably like, 'they running this, b'
But naw, I'll doubt we'll ever be
Its funny cats don't remember me
And don't think 'cause we all here that it's gonna be all we
Or all love, it's all bugged
Trying to mask them emotions with pounds and hugs
No more I say gotta make'em pay
'Cause I'm tired of getting stepsonned in the worst way just wait
Them chips on my shoulder getting attached
When my pockets catch up Pooh's never turning back

(Phonte)
Yo I ain't never heard a act to blow and go global
Then come back home and still be called local

And learn your dirty lines?
And keep her hair cropped

So let me bust a nut, we creepin', so hurry up get yo ass in this telly
No time for speakin', remove your clothes and lay on your belly

Block shit, bitches love to fuck with this

Reek Daddy the muthafuckin' instigator
Mr. get this shit started right now, fuck later
From the Crest to the muthafuckin' Midwest, Reckless

Bitch have you ever rolled with a rider?
Bouncin' in the low hollerin' out Crestsider!
Ripped, don't even trip, its gon' be some more shit
I got the big clip, filled up with hollow tips
Cold Crest creeper and I always keep my cannon on me
Don't forget the dope 'cause I'm a lay you where you standin' homie
Hoe if you know me, you know what I'm about
Act like a snake bit my dick and suck the poison out
(Mac Mall)
Cuddie I go way back, sippin' heem straight like chris mack
In the 'lac, yac up, aliens better back up
Playa like OG bust
See there ain't nothing like that ball hog soup, for country club hog nuts
Smash fools like Barlow, serve big game like tip toe
Might catch me mackin' in Chicago
Smokin' on some ????
Pimp shit, talkin' smooth, armani man, I'm out to conquer the globe
Might start off in Vegas, hookers bringin' more of those papers
Boss mackin' got me scuffin' my gators
Call me Luke Skywalker, the alien stalker
Cuddie, fuck ya friends, ya folks, even ya potna
Lil' soldier got a chopper plus he gone off one

So he's bread to kill, and ain't scared to die

You can't even hold the microphone without it feedbacking
Since the days of speed rapping I've been snapping cats spinal bones
(Em) barras them in front of women take their little titles home
Bear in mind I come from an era in time
Where you actually had to have lyrics that rhyme
Let my baritone grind your insides, paralyse your cerebellum
Throw with your reality out of a nine mit?
Flip shit, on some pimp shit, on some rock shit
Some rap rock testosterone rip shit
Look inside every magazine you read about me
Got an excerpt, your sissy ass crew's afraid to say the fucking f-word
Tired of playing games, I don't know the password
How's about this open up the damn cash drawer
Throw the keys on the dashboard
Let the real players play this shit
Yah can fucking wretch up?

Pack up get started walking
Fall back now on your losses
You can't accomplish
But you won't defeat no contest baby

Forfeit don't rock the call pit???
Chalk this up as a conquest
Some things is sacred
I don't play with my stage or my audience

Smooth talking charismatic ass ill
Talk you lady outta bra
Honda hatchback hand held y'all starved
And I'm dangling a shrimp by the fan tail
Whole audience about to fall over the handrail
I can't tell is that rapping?
Dude sound like a fucking parrot just crash landed
Man this shit is ass backwards these days real crazy
I can count on one hand cats that's truly creative
And the rest is all get along go along guys
Happy not to get involved just along for the ride
No vision, no drive, spirit or wherewithal
You can get mad and stay mad at that I don't care at all
Huge parafoils keep 'em cool under a parasol
Paragon of my era like sarah born?
How many different kinda tracks have y'all heard me on
Exactly and I served them all

I spent ten years in these god forsaken rap trenches
With small daily victories this shits a game of inches
I sustained minor injuries scuffles with the missus
For the chance to make history I don't regret it for a minute
Seeing cats drop a small fortune on plush ride blau?
Couple years later fools is upside down
Tell me what the fuck did you get in this game for
It's like a whole world of squirrels only one acorn
I don't usually like to take it back
But realistically if this was a different era
Y'all would fail miserably
Ghetto team I'm going in, take me down fifty feet
I never let this industry put me in the guillotine
Rapelle down the skyscraper kicking in the plexiglass
Plastique on the safe boom blown to Leningrad
Stuff the cash and the formula in the fifty bag
Slide down the rope, twenty stories hail a taxi cab

Tell the sun to start moving again
The taste of your kiss I've still got on my lips
And I'll take you there with me

Head crashed down, air condition myself to sleep
A great night out, that will continue to the end of the week
And all that I've seen means nothing to me, without you

Open a de herb gate sellin pure ganja
Babylon come but they undercova
They never really want me stop sell ganja
(They just wanna take a cut of what you make so far!)
But I'm not havin' it, I load the SLR
Pack the ganja BOOM! They break down the door
Pop-pop! T'ree shots, exchanged at close range
Out of three Babylon, me hit one in the brain
Pop-pop! Two shots hit da window pane
I exchanged four shots, I drop and feel pain
But I'm not hit, into the bathroom I crawl
I look out the window, it's a one story fall
I'm fallin', hit the ground and start crawlin
Soon I'm walkin' 'round, blendin in with the crowd
Another day, I got away, I gotta fix this problem someday
But the very next day...

(Chorus: repeat 2X)
Can't stop, won't stop - sellin mad izm
All competition - I gots to get wit 'em
Me nah go jail and me nah go prison

I'm in another herb gate like a superstar
Eleven A.M., things are safe so far
I used to worry 'bout the competition on the block
But now the competition on the block is the cops
And even block watch doesn't know where we lay
Well... (""Open up! It's the D.E.A.!"")
Aww man, just when I went for more lead
The door opens up, I got a glock to my forehead
(""Get down! Get on the floor!"") I felt the stick, I thought I was dead
But I woke up instead in a cell layin on my bed
I lay back down, then I heard the crack sound
Two D.T.'s came in and laid they glocks down
One was whistlin a love song, as he put some gloves on
I thought to myself, damn something's wrong
Boom bap! Boom ba, p against my head
I fell back on the bed, down to his feet
The pain was insane but the hit was sweet
Cause these dumb-ass cops punched me right by the heat
The glock, two shots, three shots they screamin
Then someone said... (""Hey wake up kid, you're dreamin'!"")
I said, ""Yo dreamin'?! That nightmare was hell""
But as I look around, I was still in my cell
Damn, I got myself caught up in a jam
The D.T. that woke me up was like, WHAT?!
I wiped the saliva, off my mouth
The D.T. said... (""Let's make a deal"") No doubt!
No question, now we started up the session
No need for guessin, yes they want my supplier
I said, what makes you think there's anyone higher?
He said... (""Don't be a God damned liar!"")
You killed three D.T.'s yesterday, you heard me
But still the cops you knocked off yeah was dirty
Now the whole investigation is federal
We want you to point out, the rest of the cops that are criminal
He continued to say, you can't think it through
This whole drug game is BIGGER than you!
Follow our plan man and you'll be free
Let me explain one thing so you can see, we

(KRS-One)
Now I'm back in the herb gate, all wired up
Constantly thinkin' about bein tied up
Snap out of it - I'm thinkin', ""Damn we like elves!
The federal and local cops got wars with themselves;
And I'm in the middle, and can't solve the riddle.
My nose is runny.."" {*knock at door*} (""Let me get a 20!"")
A 20 of the green or a 20 of the brown?
(""Gimme the whole pound, clown, or duck down!"") {*gunfire*}
God damn, God damn, here we go again
But this time I'm set up by my federal friend
Suddenly I hear... (""Yo, move from the door!"") {*two shots*}
Followed by the shot sounded like a four-four {*two shots*}
After the violence, then there was silence
Then I heard... (""Hey yo it's us, open up the door!"")
But rule number one in this game is self-reliance
So I picked up the mini-mac in case they wanted more
The door opened up, the feds said WHATTUP?
They was stickin you up, so they had to get bucked
Suddenly a sense of trust came over me
I thought to myself, ""Well soon I'll be free!""
But as I turned around, I heard the gun go click {*clik-clak*}
I said wait, but it was too late - {*GUNSHOT*}

Stop the cryin' now, just try to smile now

At an hour long ballet class then on to the piano
Two hours of repetition, emulatin' class with music compositions
Do your homework with precision
By nine-o-clock she collapses in a heat of dizziness
But sleep so tomorrow you'll repeat ya busi-ness
She got straight A's a stroke of her stress
Throughout her maydays but drawn up out the melees
Her mom and dad tryna blame each other different ways she stop and gaze
Thinkin' how it drives her crazy when their voices raised
This the web that ruins most of her days
From her perfection was expected
An exec that workin' hard without receivin' any raise
At night she cries when she lays
Then she wakes up, washes up smiles and goes along like it's okay
On to high school, there's more intensity within her cycle
She's makin' all the guys drool
Here comes the extra tight rules
No late, not with college on the plate
Practice hard, study hard stay in focus keep ya head straight
Now she's a nervouse wreck, lookin' to collect
Anything that she can smoke swallow drink or inject
When she was mentally gone she went to the prom
Had dates and actually could sit down
Discuss relationships with her mom
But tell me how much pressure can a person take
Before they break and maybe crush this on a large enough escape
So one night she turned in but stayed up late
At her desk with a single piece of paper and a papermate
Here's mom a federal team waked at daybreak
What she saw made her knees shake the death of dear Kate
The note said here's the future of your fuckin' perfect child
Please be proud I'm livin' for the now
Do your work, clean your room now
Take the makeup off your face now
Eat your dinner now, get off the phone now
Leave the boys alone now
Saturday night, you stayin' home now
Go to your room and sit alone now

Slide in the Benz, fins, bubble-eye lens,

It's the birdman, daddy, with the Gucci and Prada,
Slant-back, cut truck. No rims? Can't holla.

Royal blue Jag on them twenty-two's.

In that Cadillac truck on them twenty-three's.

All these naked women that pop champagne.

If you know my name, then you know my game.

167,"She's a slack one, born of greed.
Speaking endless words, long and empty.
A beggar who still wants to choose,
A dethroned queen still demands her due.
If you want something for nothing you take what you get,
A virgin whore in a dirty wedding dress.

Scream for salvation, beating on death's door.
But just be careful what you wish for.

There's a blood stain on the ceiling,
But you're the only duck in the shooting gallery.
Trying to look through a bricked-in window,
Your destiny lies in the alley below.
Trying to see yourself in a shattered mirror,
When all else fails, she holds you with broken arms.
There's poison in her veins, but the bitch comes for free,
A quick fix for all that you think that you need.

Scream for salvation, beating on death's door.
But just be careful what you wish for.
The patron saint of fools answers all your request,
She's all yours now, so deal with it.

There's no shoulder left to cry wolf on,
You're tied in knots that can't be undone.
No more warnings will fall on deaf ears,
You lied too many times now no one cares.
No one cares.

An empty promise with a heart of tin,
Her crooked smile beguiles and it draws you within.
The hope for something more, all that you wish for,
A kick to the head and a boot to the door.
Chasing a dragon in a lady's clothes,
A paper trail ends in choking smoke.
But you know you lit the match yourself,
Play the burning cards that you dealt

Scream for salvation, beating on death's door.
But just be careful what you wish for.
The patron saint of fools answers all your request,
She's all yours now, so deal with it.

You sold your soul but you deserve no pity
You'll climb the steps if you're of use

We won't relive a dead standard of old times
The proof is in the actions of the past
Who is the (real) enemy is the question that should be asked
But it's impossible to change the past
We're out for blood
For every ill-fated lie
Morality's suicide
Put a gun to your head
You're better off dead
Better off dead
You won't pass your bitter blood
I'll spend my every breath to undo the damage done
Your mistake will be just your mistake
Nothing more
You won't tie us to your dead and sinking
We don't relive the bigotry
We won't relive the lies
We won't relive a dead standard of old times
The proof is in the actions of the past
Who is the (real) enemy is the question that should be asked

Let it be left in the past

It's one of my niggas is dreamin' schemin on making a million
Tryin' feed they children and police keep coming around
And keep tryin' to beat you down, and take you out
Nigga don't worry God don't like evil
Shit is so clear that they can't even see through
But no matter what we do (matter what we do),
We gon' be strugglin' forever running forever
The hood that I seein' it won't get no betta
Until armageddon goes down it's not a legend
It's kinda hard to view, paradise,
But if you just try close your eyes you can view it
But reality hits you soon as you open your eyes you find
That you still live a fucked up life
And the streets done took over your mind
Figure you gotta survive, so somebody got to die
You just wanna break down and cry
But asking God to come help us please, why?

And don't be planning no future on nothing you heard, nigga,

And I'm gon' ride, won't lose no sleep over nothin'
You can save it friend
But all these years,
Face to face ain't nobody said nothin'
Livin' in these wicked days
Tryin' to get over my wicked ways
Time after time I know we tried
But losing this life everyday
And I don't wanna go out like that not me,
Lately Bone got what you want
Physically you don't wanna bleed
A la la la la la la
Hit 'em hard it's gonna be all right,
All right all right

And don't you worry bout, a damn thang
And don't you worry bout, a damn thang,
Wid all odds, against us
When the guard got me running for the fences
Aiming at these henchmen litigate shells
I'm teaming my clip wid the extra extension
I sit in my basment like it's a crackhouse bored,
Blackout 'cause I was paranoid, he enjoys what I avoid
The courts ah bowl ah, crooks
Cause bitches want the money on ya books
Destroy double eyed dotted watch devil smiles wid a cush
Gotta sell chronic to get me up some mellofied timing televised
The crucified promised in ah my ish nobody can stop us
Where the shoot out?
How many niggas you killed?
How many niggas for real?
Like Mary Louelle as long as I live
Forty five strategized like, Oh dow,
Niggas can blast at me
Bitches can pass me,
Fuck ah chicken and let's get on

(Verse 4: Flesh N Bone)

I remember like yesterday
Way back in the day coming up
Moms used to read to me everyday
Through the evening even through the afternoon
In the dawn ah book of songs,
So I'm wondering off through the wilderness
Somewhere in the valley of the shadow of death
Want to hunt me down all the need for people
Heaven I wonder will the devil catch me shall prevail
Lately even heaven is flashy sick of this amazed envy
And it ain't nothin' to see and believe in heaven in front of you
That's what I'm having a de ja vu
Lord when I lay down down to sleep
I pray for the Lord and the Holy Ghost bless my soul to keep,
And if I should die before I wake up wake up wake up wake up
I pray for the Lord to have mercy on our souls oh please Lord take us
I say to my momma peep no no more crying drying eyes
Nigga locked up at wayside
Couldn't even pay respect to my stepdad when he died
So finally got a release bid and I slide back to the county
Back to the 5-5 ride fore I touch back home
Don't worry 'bout a damn thang
Everything finna be al-right
Off to the door so bright like a knight in shining armour
Hug my wife my sons my daughter
Ain't no more reason to even bother

(Verse 5: Layzie Bone)

Look nigga I ain't worried 'bout nothing
'Cause it's a little thing I know called faith
All you need is much as a mustard seed
And the Lord will keep you safe
Whateva don't kill you will make you stronger
I promise you that just keep on pushing,
If you slip you fall and you hurt yourself
Then the Lord will provide your cushion
Determination, rules the nation whateva you facing just be a man
Believing in death before dishonor shake the drama and take a stand
For ah nigga like me see it didn't come easy
Ah nigga had to struggle and fight
At ah point and time in my life
It's like ah nigga just can't get it right
To all of my family Layzie loves ya
And I never take shit for granted
Feeling so wicked off in this planet
Man fuck tryin' to understand it
That's why I stay focused thugging and loc'dus
Stacking my bricks till I form the fifth
Momma never said it'd be like this
But nigga I'm ready for anything,
Remember to never count your eggs before they hatch
About precision timing and vision
Get up and go and don't turn back
If you ah soldier and you know it hold ya head up high
And keep stompin' in yo big black boots and don't worry

191,"Yeah... yeah... yup!
You know what? I was just downstairs
And I was on my way up here to the studio and
A guy bumped into me and
And he said... he said, ""Yo Kris!
How is it that you stay in this music?
You know, this rap music ex-specially for SO... LONG... SO... LONG""
I said, ""Well you know years ago I made a deal with the Goddess""
He said, ""The Goddess?""
I said, ""Well yeah, you might know her as God
But I know her as the Goddess""
The universal mother
The mother of everything you see in existence
I ax-ked her for assistance
In lyrical persistence
And she gave it to me, under one condition
She said, ""I'll give you the gift
But use the gift to uplift""
I said, ""Okay mom!""

So I tell you the truth, really
Me nah gon' need nuttin else
But health, wealth, and knowledge of myself
Me nah gon' need nuttin else
But health, wealth, and knowledge of myself

In the beginning was the word, the word was made flesh
Knowledge K. Reigns R. Supreme S.
Some of us guess while others of us are blessed
Take heed to the word, that I manifest
I manifest the future, the present, followed by the past
Everything in nature, rules by kickin ass
What they tellin' me, but yo, you a friend to me
So I'ma tell you the secrets of MC longevity
Secret one: if it ain't fun, you're done
And about your career, huh, well choose another one
If you don't like what you do, you're through
Lesson two: make sure you got a dope crew
Not some crew, that's like an anchor on a shoe
A MAD CREW, that's of some benefit to you
Lesson three, might be contradictory or funny
But MC's should have OTHER WAYS of gettin' money
That's to say learn other things beside music
Make money elsewhere, Hip-Hop you won't abuse it
Too many MC's, just emcee
So their longevity, is based on an Uncle Tom
At the record company
Lesson four: sell your image, never sell a record
Image is respected, records come and go
And get collected
Even the records of platinum artists, that used to rip shop
Can be bought, for a quarter at the thrift shop
Which brings me to lesson number five, the illusion
Has me thinkin', the minute they drop a record
They'll be cruisin, in the Acura
Slow down! You're still a amateur
What separates the pro from the amateur is stamina
Not how long you can rhyme, but how long you've been rhymin
Changin with the times, and findin yourself
Still CLIIIIIIIIIIIIMbin for wealth
Blow for blow, you're still growin', still showin
(All knowin') now that's a pro at it

Me nah gon' need nuttin else
But health, wealth, and knowledge of myself
Me nah gon' need nuttin else
But health, wealth, and knowledge of myself

Take a chance on a love that can last

You get up early
And I'm still sleeping
Wake me up with a cup and a smile
Were talking and laughing
All close and easy
Then you pull away
When your grieving reminds

You slip through the cracks again
To what might have been
Dance a waltz with your rose colored past
But I'm here you see
Not a memory
Take a chance on a love that can last and last

I don't expect us to start out empty
We carry our scars and loves bracelet of charms
But I am your friend and now I'm your lover
This true love will do you no harm
This true love will do you no harm

Reach out for me
Reach out for yourself
We'll live for today while we honor the past
Can't you hear it the music has started
Ah my love may I have this dance
Raise your glass

Driving through the wheat fields of South Dakota

You can have it if it means the much to you
Don't let me stop you
Don't let me stop you now

Stretch me out across the table
Turn my insides out
Turn me into someone else
Someone more like yourself

Stretch me out
Bother not with ties, I promise to lie perfectly still
I swear not to scream 
At my becoming part of the machine

Let it be known that this is what you'll get
For falling out of line
No one wins against the machine
So get back in line

Are you the man now?
That you got what you wanted
Are you the man now?
That you got it?

I must be invincible wit Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
(All the way)

(Verse 6: Krayzie)
In this world I'm simply tryna get rich and make a livin'

(Verse 7: Layzie)
This for makin' pushes outta the bushes
And makin' these hits stay move the streets
Rebels and warriors all ova the globe
Find their souls to the rockin' feet

We could chill in the hood look mansion ansion

Hey Mr. K. Ceiling do you know sumthin's wrong

I'm so green, it's really amazing
I'm so clean, too bad I can't get all the dirt off of me
I'm so sane, it's driving me crazy
It's so strange, I can't believe it
Feels just like I'm falling for the first time

Anyone perfect must be lying, anything easy has its cost
Anyone plain can be lovely, anyone loved can be lost
What if I lost my direction, what if I lost sense of time?
What if I nurse this infection, maybe the worst is behind?
It feels just like I'm falling for the first time
It feels just like I'm falling for the first time

I'm so chill, no wonder it's freezing
I'm so still, I just can't keep my fingers out of anything
I'm so thrilled to finally be failing
I'm so done, turn me over 'cause it
Feels just like I'm falling for the first time

Anything plain can be lovely, anything loved can be lost
Maybe I lost my direction, what if our love is the cost?
Anyone perfect must be lying, anything easy has its cost
Anyone plain can be lovely, anyone loved can be lost
What if I lost my direction, what if I lost sense of time?

As my throat's swollen when you're dead

As I glance back at you
You continue to lie to me you have lied to me
No matter how much blood is lost now
Under a dying sky you are swept away

You are so beautiful
I felt safest in your arms
On the brink of extinction
Hands around my neck and turn to save me now

As despair is a distant closure
Walk across me body and kiss my lips
Continue to beat me

You are so beautiful

Move yourself
Step back from me
Walk away from me
Under a dying sky

I felt safest in your arms, On the brink of extinction
Hand around my necks and turn to save me now

Between your smile and your sleight of hand
I'd guess that you put something up my sleeve
Now every time I see your face the bells ring in a far-off place
We can find each other this way I believe

From the hills and up behind, my town
Is naked from the horizon down
The curvature is pressed against the raise
We walked up in the fields alone
And the silence fell just like a stone
That got lost in the wild blue and the gravel grey

Come and find me now

Though I'm here in this far off place
My air is not this time and space
I draw you close with every breath
You don't know it's right until it's wrong
You don't know it's yours until it's gone
I didn't know that it was home till you up and left

Come and find me now

I keep you in a flower vase
With your fatalism and your crooked face
With the daisies and the violet brocades
And I keep me in a vacant lot
In the ivy and forget-me-nots
Hoping you will come and untangle me one of these days

Come and find me now

Washing away the pain loss brings
And then you smile though it aches

Just that we made a mess of things

When the deal
That you made with love
Is just a one way street, a one way street
You feel
You'll go overboard
'Cause you're incomplete, incomplete.

You're not afraid to rely
On any way you can try
To learn to make some sense of things.
And the way you say we'll get by
With a little laugh we can fly
You know the measure of hope that brings.

I hear you laughing like a child
Instead of choking all riled
Instead of staring at shortcomings.
Just like the rain when you cried
Washed all the stains of false pride
You'll learn to make the best of things.

More of what is less but isn't love
Little of the same you're dreaming of
That's enough, that's enough.

As saline drips from her prom dress, damp hands are desiccated
There's a wolf at the window of the second floor
Who kidnaps your date with a new car

We both want the same thing
Bad poetry and assaults at the bar
Just try and stop me
We are the only one in the world

Prepare the ballroom
Quicksand in front of the coat check
Waltz with the scarecrow in the spotlight through the rye
I was born a wanted man
But I'll die a sailor's wife
God help me pick the lock to her room

I have to make this right
Scream the hounds to sleep for me
I'm creeping around in your head like a vine

Your spit is the meat
Of the rose harvested by the dull
Let fly the doves,
Unhook their leather wings from the fog
Put your foot and mouth together
For the sweethearts of Vietnam

In a photo taken of us
At the reception held at the jail
Loverboy is breaking up
Just to the right side of me

I will stop at nothing
I am the siren that sings you home
Is that clear?
I will stop at nothing
I am the tooth in your jewelry box
Is that clear?

Let pry the crows
Unhook their crooked beaks from the clock

Bolt the gate and head for the ivory tower
Adoration is cutting the phone lines to your heart
Love is here

I am the snarling and starry-eyed

We both want the same thing
Better aim at the stranger in our yard
Just try to stop me
I am the blinding light of your life
Prepare the body
I've been better but thanks for asking
Wait with the scarecrow for the spotlight in the rye

I'll eat you alive
The calm will come again

I wanted no one else

I got you to myself

In favorable slavery

I guess it wasn't meant to be

241,"There ain't no stopping us now
I'd like to say that from the outset
Not up in this business just to get what we can get
But bet that
We gonna bring it to you loud and clear
How loud I gotta say it 'fore you people start to hear
I can name our problems
But I know a solution
Bring back the revolution.
The revolution comes and we all stand as one
Rises from the darkness and shines like the sun
As the sun gets higher, our church catches fire
Down from our pride and up from the mire.
It's a dream that I've had and I hope it comes true
I forgot to say the revolution starts with you.

See wisdom and knowledge is one thing that we lack
You've been a Christian how long and you're still on Similac
So I call on Martin Luther and all the reformation back
Then the common people couldn't read God's revelation
You had to be a monk or a priest or read Latin
That was all before the revolution happened
But the fire cooled down ever since that generation
We put down the Bible and pick up the Playstation
And we can't defend our faith 'cause we don't even know it
We say we love his word but pick a funny way to show it.
The world walks by and we don't have a thing to say
I call 'em as I see 'em
And that's what I see today

The revolution returns
The reformation lives on
The great awakening is now
Sleepers open your eyes
A war is on, our rally cry is no compromise
No compromise, yeah, no compromise
A war is on, our battle cry is no compromise
So throw your fist up and pray the revolution rise
A war is on, our rally cry is no compromise

Our hearts have grown so cold
And we've such numb souls
But shirts and bumper stickers
Man we got 'em by the truckload
Is true religion what you have around your wrist
What does the scripture say of this
""They honor me with words
But their hearts are far away""
I call 'em like I see 'em
And that's what I see today

So I call on John Edwards
Who preached us all awake
We try to be emotional but here is our mistake
As a church we lack repentance and we lack true affection
Not only in our minds but our hearts need correction
And man that's true religion, resignation and contrition
To love each other so much that we'd die before division

So what about you
Will you join us
Will you admit that the waters around us have grown
You better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
Do you stand with us or do we stand alone
It's time that we stand up, enlist for the war
I've tasted battle and now I want more
I've known the truth and been cut to the core
But I'm back in the game to even the score
And I mean to go out with both my guns blazing
Amazed at a God who's so truly amazing
To triumph in battle as the spirit enables
Can't turn back the clock but we can turn the tables

",5
242,"God only knows how I've needed a friend
Who can see through the boldness and pride
Someone strong enough I can put my faith in
Someone willing to let me inside
So be a man
And be my man

I dare you to need me
Like nobody else
I dare you to feel me
Like you've never felt
I dare you to want to want
To wanna be good to me

Baby you've got your reasons
Dangling from kite strings
But you can open your hands, let them fly
Oh I know you won't always say and do the right things
Oh but some things are worth a try
So if you can
Be my man

I dare you to know me
Like I've never known
I dare you to show me
That I can be shown
Dare you to want to want
To wanna be good to me

Tell me I
Tell me I'm the one who deserves you
Oh and every time
Every time you know that you want to
I dare you

I dare you to hold me
Like you never will again
Kiss me and leave the world standing still
Dare you to want to want
Oh
Dare you to need me

Dare you to feel me

Dare you to want to want
To wanna be good to me

The kind you see from airplanes baby that's the deal, that's the deal
A place to plan a future a place to keep the past
A place to raise some kids what's wrong with that, wrong with that

Maybe it's the same routine
Walking on a concrete
Running like a river so deep
Wearing down my high heels
Wearing down my high ideals
Of what I thought my life was supposed to be

Everybody's got a weakness some kind of kryptonite
Wearing'em down
Everybody's got dreams they can't let go don't they baby
Everybody's got a littl' secret they keep inside and mine's
Livin' happily ever afterly
With you, with you

I want to paint the world with the colors that I see
Every time I close my eyes and your kissing me, kissing me
I want to wake up in your arms so far from here
I want to get lost in the dark and know your near, know your near

Baby it's an old love song playing out loud on the radio
Bringing these thoughts on
Geting me thinking there might be a little bit more
Than what I'm working for
Or maybe it's just me

Everybody's got a weakness some kind of kryptonite
Wearing'em down
Everybody's got dreams they can't let go of don't they baby
Everybody has a littl' secret they keep inside and mine's

Life can take your dreams and turn them upside down
Friends will talk about you when you're not around
Reality can really cut you down to size
But don't ever lose that light in your eyes
Don't ever lose that light in your eyes

People make you promises they'll never keep
Soon you'll know why people say, ""Talk is cheap!""
Life resembles one big compromise
But don't ever lose that light in your eyes
Don't ever lose that light in your eyes

Keep on shining
Keep on smiling
Don't lose faith and don't lose heart
When you're crying
Just keep trying to remind yourself you're a shining star
Yes you are

Somewhere down the line you'll face the judgement day
When the angels look at you... what will you say?
They've got a way of knowing who qualifies
Just let 'em see that light in your eyes

Keep on shining
Keep on smiling
Don't lose faith and don't lose heart
When you're crying
Just keep trying to remind yourself you're a shining star
Yes you are

Don't ever lose that light in your eyes
Don't ever lose that light in your eyes

A memory of Sunday class
Resurrected from the past

Pinky swears don't work no more
Footsteps down the hallway floor
Getting closer to my door
I was alive, but now I'm singing

Silent Night for the rest of my life
Silent Night for the rest of my life
Violent Knight at the edge of your knife
""Forgive me, Father"" won't make it right
Silent Night for the rest of my life
Silent Night at the edge of your knife

Killed the boy inside the man
The holy water in his hands
Can never wash away his sins

Somebody's going down

Feel it now and don't resist

It's locked its jaws and now it's swallowing

It's in our love, baby, it's in our bed

Tonight I go to hell
For what I've done to you

Reveals his face and searches for relief

Attracted only till it comes unglued

Into unforgiving night we plunge! 
Chained by sin and clothed by guilt

Country garland in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes the people all complain

Wishing well with a golden bell
Bucket hanging clear to hell
Hell halfway twixt now and then
Stephen fill it up and lower down and lower down again

Lady finger, dipped in moonlight
Writing ""What for?"" across the morning sky
Sunlight splatters dawn with answer
Darkness shrugs and bids the day good-bye

Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned

Several seasons with their treasons
Wrap the babe in scarlet covers, call it your own

Did he doubt or did he try?
Answers aplenty in the bye and bye
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills

Saint Stephen will remain
All he lost he shall regain
Seashore washed by the suds and the foam
Been there so long, he's got to calling it home

Spinning that curious sense of your own

To break up the ice that got the rap world frozen

So please, make a call, tell your friend, tell the hood

Till I get my respect I'm holdin' dope for ransom

Hand 'em over boys, your jewels and your girls
Bow down to the sound cause ""Murs Rules the World""

But it don't take much these days for you to master the mic
Most of these rappers trapped in the hype
They makin' whole albums, only half of it's tight
So they never really have an impact on your life
That's why ""3:16"" was genius...
We all connected through this ""Minstrel Show"" man, I mean it
Until my days end I'm gettin' paid my friend
Without pimpin' my soul, the gangster limpin was old
So I ""Walk Like a Man"" and, talk to my fans
Clocked a few grand but you gotta understand
I got a little money and I, coulda bought a chain
But my momma woulda killed me, simple and plain
Exchange foreign currency, for legal tender

Baby you're my shining star.

That's where I'm from... man

It's still our life
If you keep yo head up everything will be all right
In living your life

(Napoleon)
I'm damn near 'bout to go in tears
Writin' this verse here
I feel like I'm cursed here
I'm choked up since I lost my peers
But I know one day we be back again
One love to my Mexicans
Tryin' to run across the border
To see freedom all over again
Man... One love to my Africans
They try to kill us with AIDS
But they smart again
It's like I die once that I be born again
With the grace of Allah
Kept away my sins
From the ghetto where they play with heavy metal to win
Lost my parents so I moved with my next-of-kin
Life... just so mych pain to me
To tell the truth I don't wanna die angrily
Makaveli and Kadafi, them trained me
I feel y'all in the dark steady hatin' me

It's still our life

Videos, movies, money, jewels and girls
Rolls Royces, Hummers, Jagz and all that
Hard to believe one night in Vegas changed all that
Fast forward... 6 years

Despite be hated on (huh)
We still clear
Until the end of time you can't stop destiny
Back for everything they owe
Now let's go

I got the spirit of a angel
The heart of a soldier
The mind of a militant
Was blessed by my mother
The inspiration of my life
She 4 years clean
With 15 years on the pipe
And she just got married
I felt pain... ya sayin' Pac smilin' at the wedding
Never forget her mah'
Y'all baby fool, I promise to ya Imma stay a trooper

Needles and pens
These 2 Tims was my Beemer
Before I heard of a Benz
I got lost tryin' to find my ends
And got crossed tryin' to find me a friend
That's life...
We sacrifice for better days
We pray for a better way that never came
Hey! (hey... hey)
What's more precious then a innocent child, smilin'
??? Was foul, look at his smile
School's not cool
Them big body rules
The workin' man's a fool
If he can't afford the jewels
Look at how life use ya
Abuse and confuse ya
Remember we was suppose to be the future?
Now we grown
The future is here and we gone
Oh where did we go wrong
Let's live...
And do right by these kids my friend
They the only shot we got at living life again

Crying out those eyes
Run away from all the pain, all the pain in life

A 12-gauge cross kisses the forehead 
A savior in a shell

Can peace be found
On the carpet above ground?
Where sky is forever blue

So let it pass baby now
The slow inviting cloud
Which may take me from you

Many things a man can lose, his self, his rights, his views
But never his heart or his love
So take this hand of mine and climb baby climb
To the hill up above

Now you can play a queen on the hill built on a dream
While our children play in the field
I can smoke the pipe of a sweet and better life
And trust in the strength of the shield

So trust in you love and you'll see up above
And let light pass like a wheel
Don't take the chance of life's hectic dance
Kiss the strength of the shield

The seeker will be found
By the looker underground
And to his wish he will yield

Fate will have its word of course
But time will change its course
And hold the strength of the shield

non c'&#232; niente da perdere, nous sommes le Clan Banlieue.

Ce ne andremo a curiosare per le strade dell'Europa
con le multe non pagate sul cruscotto.
Pablo cerca di convincerci a tornare a Barcellona
per noi due l'importante &#232; che si schiodi.
Scriveremo cartoline agli amici del quartiere
che si sciolgono nel caldo dell'estate.
Li ritroveremo un giorno e brinderemo al nostro incontro
ai vecchi tempi e alle nostre nuove vite.

E da tutte le provincie, d'oriente e d'occidente
dai sobborghi soffocati dalla noia
uno sciame di furgoni malconci e colorati
investir&#224; le grandi capitali. On se taille d'ic&#236;!

Guildford, Castrovillari, Sassuolo, La Villette
non c'&#232; niente da perdere, nous sommes le Clan Banlieue.

Erlangen, Manzolino, Isernia, Lisdonvarna, Liege, Valladolid
non c'&#232; niente da perdere.
Voghera, Codigoro, Zandvoort, Montecavolo,
East Kilbridge, Rieti, Arcore. Nous sommes le Clan Banlieue.

282,"Now you're in a jam, hold your head between your hands.
Clench your fist to keep your ground,
In a war that can't be won.

Banned to the borstal, now you're cornered.
Banned to the borstal, you're disordered.
Banned to the borstal, now you're locked away... like buried.

Cry, you have no choice.
Punishment at any price.
You submit to what the wankers say,
Just to live another day.

Open you're eyes and you'll see.
You're just a toy of their schemes.
Open your eyes and you'll see.
They try to prevent that you're free.

Now they let you down, and you feel you're all alone.
Just the dreams of yesterday, help you stand another day.

She's the holy ghost lost without a trace

And it seems to me 
She's a casualty of all the pressure 
That we put on her 
And now we've lost her for good 
It's such a shame shame shame 
That our homecoming queen 
Was a lot like you and a lot like me 
And she never walked on water

She was so adored by everyone 
When it came to looks she was next to none 
But loved partying and having too much fun 
Then she hooked up with the wrong someone 
And he promised everything under the sun 
And it seems to me 
She's a casualty of all the pressure 
That he put on her 
And now we've lost her for good

Just looking for somebody to love her

Wish I could've saved you 
From losers that drained you 
Before you got strung out 
With so much potential 
How could you let us down

Was a lot like you and a lot like me

I can see the hurt behind your smile
For every sign I recognize
Another one escapes me

Let me know what plagues your mind
Let me be the one to know you best
Be the one to hold you up
When you feel like you're sinking

Tell me once again
What's beneath the pain you're feeling
Don't abandon me
Or think you can't be saved

I walk beside you
Wherever you are
Whatever it takes
No matter how far

Through all that may come
And all that may go
I walk beside you
I walk beside you

Summon up your ghosts from me
Rest your tired thoughts upon my hands
Step inside this sacred place
When all your dreams seem broken

Resonate inside this temple
Let me be the one who understands
Be the one to carry you
When you can walk no further

Tell me once again
What's below the surface bleeding
If you've lost your way
I will take you in

I walk beside you
Wherever you are
Whatever it takes
No matter how far

Through all that may come
And all that may go
I walk beside you
I walk beside you

Oh when everything is wrong
Oh when hopelessness surrounds you
Oh the sun will rise again
The tide you swim against will carry you back home
So don't give up

But the words don't come out right
Try and explain how nobody can do me like

Since the day that we met
Oh can you feel it yet?

It's never been more perfect being alive
I've never been so satisfied

I'm taking it all
And now I'm caught in the air

Pass it up, wouldn't dare
Oh, What a wild ride
I remember being ready
And waiting to fall
Just like I did tonight

Spinning around and around
Until my left was my right
And up became down
With just one look
You knocked me off of my feet
So unable to speak
Oh how you made me weak
Though it was a while ago
I still can recall
That moment, so ready
And waiting to fall
Can you take me back in time
Remembering when
You captured my heart
Over and over again

It's never been more perfect being alive
I've never been so satisfied

Pushed your button, rang your bell, you didn't hear me knock
I saw your window open wide, so I crawled inside
I ran to the top floor, but you were on the ground
I was on my way up and you were going down

Fire in the basement
Burn me up, scream and shout
There's fire in the basement
Only you can put it out

This strange sensation that I'm going through
Sweet infatuation when I get next to you
I know what it takes to be a man, you understand
'Cause when the sparks start flying you'll never be the same
You know I'll hate to leave you girl, but I'm so glad I came

Fire in the basement
Burn me up, scream and shout
Fire in the basement

'Cause I'm KRS and I'm on the mic, and Premier's on The Breaks

If you don't know me by now I doubt you'll ever know me
I never won a Grammy, I won't win a Tony
But I'm not the only MC keepin' it real
When I grab the mic to smash a rapper, girls go ""Illlll!""
Check the time as I rhyme, it's 1995
Whenever I arrive the party gets liver
Flow with the master rhymer, that's to leave behind
The video rapper, you know, the chart climber
Clapper, down goes another rapper
Onto another matter, punch up the data, Blastmaster
Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everybody
Call up KRS, I'm guaranteed to rip a party
Flat top, braids, bald heads or natty dread
There once was a story about a man named Jed
But now Jed is dead, all his kids instead
Want to kick rhymes off the top of they head
Word, what go around come around I figure
Now we got white kids callin' themselves niggas
The tables turned as the crosses burned
Remember You Must Learn
About the styles I flip and how wild I get
I go on like a space age rocket ship
You could be a mack, a pimp, hustler or player
But make sure live you is a dope rhyme sayer

This is what you waited all year for
The hardcore, that's what KRS is here for
Big up Grand Wizard Theodore, gettin' ill
If you see then ya saw I'm in your grill with mad skill
MC's can only battle with rhymes that got punchlines
Let's battle to see who headlines
Instead of flow for flow let's go show for show
Toe for toe, yo, you better act like you know
Too many MC's take that word 'emcee' lightly
They can't Move a Crowd, not even slightly
It might be the fact that they express wackness
Let me show ya whose ass is the blackest
I flip a script a little bit, you ride the tip and shit
Too sick to get with it, admit you bit, your style is counterfeit
Now tone it down a bit
My title you will never get, I'm too intelligent
I'll send your family my sentiments, my style is toxic
When I rock and shock and hip hop it unlock your head, I knock it
It split quick from the lyric
Direct hit, perfect fit, you can't get with it

Some MC's don't like the KRS but they must respect him
'Cause they know this kid gets all up in they rectum
Slappin' and selectin' em, checkin' em, disrespectin' em
Just deckin' em, deckin' em, deck-in' em
Who in their right mind can mimic a style like mine?
I design rhyme and get mine all the time
MC's standin' on the sidelines, always dissin'
When I roll up and rush their crew they start bitchin'
I don't burn, I don't freeze, yet some MC's
Believe they could tangle with the likes of these
Cross your t's and dot your I's whenever I arrive
Wide, magnified, live like the ocean tide
You dope, you lied, I reside like artifacts
On the wrong side of the tracks, electrified
Comin' around the mountain, you run and hide
Hopin' your defence mechanism can divert my heat-seeking lyricism
As I spark mad iszm
The 1996 lyrical style's what I give 'em

294,"On a sunny afternoon in lower east side New York...
You about ready? (Yeah)
Good morning my sweet vision of morbid disorder
And good evening wonderful riddance and such
Maybe today I'll touch the burgundy halo
Trimming the tunnels and offend with tenants
Spangled cross a more tangible premise
This splendor shit needs splinters all up in day-tripper visuals
Take it easy man, fuck it I'll take it any way I can
My palms are generous
When I witness fury scurry past my window
Model city in a bottle plugged hostile
Its bliss kissing polluting
And a billion suckers pucker in a bind
Maybe the sunken ship is the treasure
No, but they insist it man
I try to spin me dizzy sponging
Spongin up the given dungeons functions
As opposed to art historians absorbed inside assumptions
Everybody pop your knuckles when the style divorces vertical
Marveling at the spite with which it curdled
Outside my tenement grows a little warmth
From out the mugs of masons wasted
Laying bricks for days to later find they owned the lot adjacent
Mark the blasphemy elements of elegance and savagery
Murder the gossip, fuck it run off happily
The broken spoke cyclers choking open doctors they as born fetus
In a matchbox conveniently padlocked to the hammer base
Now these impurities embedded in five illiterate's textiles
Shedded in the hell tale to motivate blind suspended leverage
Now I'm drowning in a pool of... why are you here?
Sabotage with my beast of burden pertinence of if I die this year
My name is Dry spell
My name is pillar
My name's allegiance
My name is flagrant
My name's a thousand steps from patience
But I'm sick and tired of waiting

And clock the profits for the captive's sake
Let us hope that the horrors of evil no longer loiter on the doorstep of your past
Circle of sandbags drag the shield a meal the meaty hand grabs
I'm splitting hopes at your local Acropolis
Opulence in a cockpit not the pocket for them born with a pepper toss
Sunk to rest while they've exhausted the art of drunken address
Exhibit fracture lines that converge towards where the hackers whine
Where trappers slack the traps
Unlatch the catch then cover up his trackers line
That will make his majesty furious
Oh bury his head and how could I have been so dense
If only, yeah but I'm lonely
My days graze normalcy then morbidly crash
My years breathe honesty then sardonically laugh
Alas, I dig my toes in to the sand and spit foliage out my lips personifying mankind's end all aspirations
Hope floats...
No, hope sinks like broken boats and most harassed before provoked
I'm tossing darts at a map of the arts to pick up where you choked
And when the last leaf falls off the branches of resonance
I'll be waiting with my butterfly net to collect the evidence
Well I am a room with poison oak scaling the sides
Arachnids on the ceiling, rugged thumb tacks, bones and rusty pipes
If you can squeeze between the bars
Enjoy my space employ my waste
And change the hand dealt by a stolen grace
Do you ever wish the circle was a square
So when land sharks start circling the borders
You could just cut them off at the corners
There's a ghost in the basket of values
Pertinent to, which kayak pilot succeeded in serving him proof
Now I'm surfing it through
So if you need me spread your wings to spell my name
Above the mess near the other funny requests
See mild to tolerant mannerisms of higher to win
To assist in a meticulous pick a part of cobweb of skins
Of innocence
A child of timid instinct with that ten step ahead premise
Supply dust bowls before the zephyr was requested
Violent humble shoes ten shades of blues come off the difference
I grimace, took me one hours blink to conclude that sickly innocence
My name is Dry spell
My name is pillar
My name's allegiance
My name is flagrant
My name's a thousand steps from patience
But I'm sick and tired of waiting

297,"Du snodde som en tjuv och slog runt som en trapetsartist
Du hade br&#228;nt varenda skepp om inte l&#229;gan d&#246;tt av syrebrist
Det var gl&#228;dje, glam och garv, det var sl&#246;seri och slarv
Alla tentor sprack och sen var det v&#229;r
N&#228;r din j&#228;nta stack, h&#246;gg det till som i ett &#246;ppet s&#229;r

Du s&#229;g dej bara om om b&#228;ngen kom och n&#228;r en holk var t&#228;nd
Du fl&#246;g i samma flumdr&#246;m, damp i samma &#229;terv&#228;ndsgr&#228;nd
Du blev varse v&#229;ld och mord p&#229; m&#228;nskor, djur och jord
Och att det &#228;r Gud och Dollarn som r&#229;r
Ja, och sprickan mellan f&#228;der och s&#246;ner blev till ett &#246;ppet s&#229;r

Vissa t&#228;nde p&#229; med zen, andra t&#228;nde p&#229; med tao
Yang och yin och Ho Chi Minh, Che och Zappa, Marx och Mao
Ett liv efter tretti &#229;r var som att ligga p&#229; b&#229;r
Kistan gapar tandl&#246;st tyst mot dej som ett &#246;ppet s&#229;r

Din dr&#246;m &#228;r d&#246;d och gl&#246;md n&#228;r ni drar p&#229; sv&#228;ng&#229;fl&#228;ngturn&#233;
Du blev en slit&#229;sl&#228;nggrej och rabblar din refr&#228;ngsucc&#233;
Det &#228;r skr&#229;l och vr&#229;l och dunk, en styrkesk&#229;l, en klunk
Det &#228;r fredagskv&#228;ll och t&#246;rsten &#228;r sv&#229;r
Du f&#229;r en pava i pannan och pallet k&#228;nns som ett &#246;ppet s&#229;r

Sen kvartar du en stund (om du har tur) och har en viss distans
N&#228;r ni s&#228;tter er i bullen och drar till n&#228;sta disco-dans
Du fnissar till och tyr dej till din tysta dialog
Samma tr&#246;tta, trygga, trasiga sp&#229;r
Medan v&#228;rlden g&#229;r mot h&#246;st och jorden bl&#246;der ur ett &#246;ppet s&#229;r

Alla flaggar med sin oskuld, alla d&#246;ljer sin list
Plikten kallar livet ut f&#246;r kung och anarkist
Du g&#229;r upp i varv och kommer inte ner mer &#8211; ens n&#228;r du f&#229;r
Om du inte tar din valium n&#228;r nerven k&#228;nns som ett &#246;ppet s&#229;r

Dom drar fram dej ur ditt modersliv och s&#228;jer: Ordet &#228;r fritt
Men du vill vakna i din egen takt och v&#228;ser: Mitt liv &#228;r mitt
Du vill vara hos dej sj&#228;lv medan skyarna flyr h&#228;n
Och g&#246;ra bara det du f&#246;rm&#229;r
Innan giftet du har svalt har spruckit ut igen som ett &#246;ppet s&#229;r

F&#246;r sen &#228;r det f&#246;r sent att f&#246;rklara och att s&#228;ja f&#246;rl&#229;t
Det brukar b&#246;rja med ett &#229;sknedslag, det brukar sluta med gr&#229;t
Den dag du tar till v&#229;ld &#228;r du pantad och s&#229;ld
D&#229; ger dom slutgiltigt fan i hur du m&#229;r
Ja, du vet det, ja du vet men denna vetskap k&#228;nns som ett &#246;ppet s&#229;r

Det &#228;r tidvis regn och periodvis uppochned
Det &#228;r tidvis sol men mest &#228;r tiden ur led
Det &#228;r tidvis bra n&#228;r du f&#229;r va ifred och kl&#228;mma en t&#229;r
N&#228;r dom tar ditt liv ifr&#229;n dej och ditt hj&#228;rta k&#228;nns som ett &#246;ppet s&#229;r

Du trampar i ett tr&#246;tthetstr&#228;sk och kommer ingenvart
Du famlar efter ljus och blundar f&#246;r att natten &#228;r svart
D&#228;rute m&#228;ts du bara efter effektivitet
Eller efter var du gal att du st&#229;r
D&#228;r fryser t&#229;rar till pikar och sm&#228;lter ner till salt i ditt s&#229;r

Dom har f&#229;tt dej att f&#246;rneka din natur och tyngas ner av skam
Dom har f&#229;tt dej att st&#228;lla dej sist i k&#246;n och hata dej fram
Du jagas av ditt minne men det brinner ingen eld
I den d&#246;da askan av ig&#229;r
Men br&#229;ten b&#228;r du med dej och b&#246;rdan k&#228;nns som ett &#246;ppet s&#229;r

Det finns inga sk&#228;l att d&#246;ma, att bli sentimental
Nuets stig &#228;r st&#228;ndigt ny och nyckfull och hal
Men ibland f&#229;r du r&#228;kna till tio g&#229;nger sju d&#228;r du g&#229;r
N&#228;r du st&#246;ter p&#229; en mina och ett minne k&#228;nns som ett &#246;ppet s&#229;r

298,"Coming home again
To see a girl that's prettier than a diamond shining in the sun
Oh what fun!
I wonder if she's been naked in her room since I've been gone
I wonder if she's said to them as she said to me before

However much you use me baby, come on use me more
However much you use me baby, come on use me more

Getting off the train
To see a girl that's sweeter than an apple picked from Adam's tree
Oh glory be!
And I wonder if she's been pressed against an unfamiliar wall
And said to all those men as she said to me before

However much you want me, I swear I'll make you want me more
However much you want me, I swear I'll make you want me more and more and more and more

Arriving at the door
Just to be told that the girl I'm missing has been in London for a while
No more northern skies for her
They say she's left a letter up the stairs for everyone
It's pinned against her bedroom door for all the world to see and she says

However much I loved you, you will always love me more
However much I loved you, you will always love me more
And I guess it's true
However much she loves me I will always love her more

I'll love you more and more, I'll love you more
I'll love you more and more, I'll love you more
I'll love you more and more, I'll love you more
I'll love you more and more, I'll love you more and more and more...

I have returned to the Northern skies
Where the summer had not touhed the clouds that pass above
Oh and I have returned to the somber greens
Of the days too early to come and too early to stay

And I have left a million stars
And I know shine so lightly, so clearly blue
And I have left the warmth of the sun
And a million adventures not yet begun

The great sense of passing through
The great sense of passing through
The great sense of passing through

Oh for once there was beauty here for me
Under these white Northern skies
And I felt the green was blacker and the blue was darker still
My roots are lying deeper than I ever think they will again

Heartache and poetry
Under these Northern skies

The great sense of passing through
The great sense of passing through
The great sense of passing through

Slow down, lie down,
Remember it's just you and me
Don't sell out, bow out,
Remember how this used to be

I just want you closer is that all right,
Baby let's get closer tonight

Grant my last request and just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders, lay down beside me
Sure I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there, lay down beside me

And I've found, that I'm bound,
To wander down that one-way road
And I realized all about your lies,
But I'm no wiser than the fool that I was before

I just want you closer is that all right,
Baby let's get closer tonight

Grant my last request and just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders, lay down beside me
Sure I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there, lay down beside me

Baby, baby, baby,
Tell me how can, how can this be wrong?

Grant my last request and just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders, lay down beside me
Sure I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there, lay down beside me
One last time let's go there, lay down beside me

299,"This is the last time I'll wait, I forced my self here
Listened to all I can take

I still remember the fall out that can't be erased
(And bite my tongue now)
I can't believe all the ways that you hold me
I break
This is the world that you burn
This is the life that you waste
How does it feel on your own
Now that your pushing me away?
Cast out the storm in my head, I've tripped and feel in
Caught in my conscience again
(I try to push it away)
In case you forget, I'll boldly just let it all fade
(And search the silence)
I can't believe all the lies that you tell me
I break

This is the world that you burn/you're pushing me away
This is the life that you waste/you're pushing me away
How does it feel? I still remember the fall out

302,"Jackknifed my strife
Take it easy, sit outside
I just died a thousand times yesterday

Lay down. drown out
Drowning in these cries and shouts
Changing so fast that it stays the same

Encryption ensconces this cryptic clich&#233;
If it's not stupid, it's more of the same
I'm too tired to care, we're too busy to think
Let's sit back and laugh and watch the ship sink

The hull and the bow and the smokestacks
Disappeared and we watched it go down
With a screaming Bronx cheer, thank you dear
I will sleep and get up and eat unaware

But don't forget to forget that you forgot me
When I show up at your door
I'm gonna remember that you are my friend
And fall asleep on your floor

Winter is coming, can you find your coat?
Let's go watch the water while the bodies still float
Slit my throat, it's more than a tad overdue
Slit my throat, I can't die in here till next June

I breathed, it was smoky
I cried and it steamed
I dreamed that I slept
And I actually dreamed

What it is a sickness
What it is is regret
And I might be dying
But I'm not dead yet

But don't forget to forget that you forgot me
When I show up at your door
I'm gonna remember that you are my friend
And fall asleep on your floor

Winter is coming, can you find your coat?
Let's go watch the water while the bodies still float
Slit my throat, it's more than a tad overdue
Slit my throat, I can't die in here till next June

I dreamed that I slept
And I actually dreamed

What it is a sickness

When I show up at your door
I'm gonna remember that you are my friend
And fall asleep on your floor

While fictitious laughter, grievous halls triumphant foe
Pointing fingers all acusing
Fading dust of ages into a night of stone

Whispers Solace, vae victis
Can you spare immortal tears?

Its orphaned children drink from the empty wells of faith
In unknown lair awaits the ember

The streets and the thousands of colours all bleed into one
I fall down, heaven won't help me
I call out, no one would hear
All of a sudden I'd lost my way out of the city

Stand tall, stand proud
Every beginning is breaking it's promise
I'm having trouble just finding some soul in this town

The names on the faces in places, they mean nothing to me
It's all they can do to be part of a queue in this town
I fall down, heaven won't help me
I call out, no one will hear
There'll be no tomorrow they say, well I say more's the pity

Stand tall, stand proud
Every beginning has broken it's promise
I'm having trouble just finding my soul in this town

But we've got our lives
A voice that's louder than any picket sign
Don't take away what is ours to keep
This very land that lies beneath our feet
Don't know about this mess we're in

Bombs are bursting in a far off land
Fire in the sky, a soldier takes his stand
But who is to know about the rules that men make
For what honor and for who's sake
Don't know about this mess we're in

The smoke is clearing and we see a light
Coming together for a different fight
All of us looking, finding our way again
Out of this mess we're in

She's walking the streets because she has no home
All she has hangs on her flesh and bones
Too many nights sleeping without a warm bed
She passes by but they just turn their heads
Don't know about this mess we're in

Old man dying from too much drink
Blood and glass laying in the bathroom sink
No one stopped to read the words that he wrote
Or care to hear to stories that he told
Don't know about this mess we're in

The smoke is clearing and we see a light
Coming together for a different fight
All of us looking, finding our way again

Jammin' that Lil' Keke ""Don't Mess Wit Texas"" CD
But right now I need you to take a... blown big break
And Lil' Keke 780'll do their latest out here 'n' do his thang
This called ""Don't You Know""
Go on ladies you need to get wet on this one

Don't you know, that I love you so
Don't you know, that I love you so, baby

Don't you know, I love you so
I wan' caress you slow, from head to toe
Deep inside I go, baby scream fo' mo'
We can play our way, at this game I'm a pro
Let you run the show, a queen you will be
Satin sheets, pat lace, Victoria's Secret
And I know your body need it gotta make your mind believe it
All above, all the love, on my purpose is defeated
You have cheated on your man to his spirits a g
When you know that he got flicks with a playa like me
I guess that Lil' Keke has the key to the do'
And I'm lettin' you ladies know that I love you so

Bubble bath in the spa, menage-a-trois
You a driver for a car, I'll make you a star
As I floss Jaguar, to wherever you are
Long distance in the distance on my cellular
And no way's too far for my private jet
I'm on a flight, hold tight, keep it nice and wet
Please don't get upset, the fun just begun
Wanna want a job done, will you make me a son?
Will you make me a daughter? Do I need to pump harder?
Turn the temperature up on the bed so we can heat 'em warmer
A heart of a villain, a thug-like nigga gets harder gets liver
More deeper to the river
You shiver you shake, ice cream and candy
I wonder how it feel when your water breaks
No mistakes allowed at the rodeo show
And I'm lettin' you ladies know that I love you so, uh

As I gaze in your eyes, it's not a surprise
That I'm the perfect size bumpin' between your thighs
Just time to realize, don't need a disguise
I'm a star on the rise, only out for the price
Dig deep into your soul, then get caught in the rapture
Yo' mind I'ma capture, night before morning after
First chapter Illuminati, beamas and benzes
7-day vacations, all-paid expenses
I'm a playa fo' life, thanks to this rap
I can floss, I can flap, with my salary cap
H-Town's on the map, and nothing is negative
I'm the owner of the firm, I make you an executive
Cause just then you will see that you do wanna be
With Lil' Keke in the land of free
Do you wanna, are you gonna? Let's sit in the sauna
And laugh our life away while we blow marijuana
It's goin' DOWN

Ah... I see the little latest out there acting bad
On that one right there
Lil' Keke from that CD ""Don't Mess... With Tex-as""
Featuring Phaz, make sure you look out for him real soon aight? heh

By your window fortune flies
In squalor, the sky descends
Grey is the color - your only friend

Synchronistic daydream collides upon your teeth
Pupils swell... Pupils swell
And the possibilities emerge
On the breath of a rat's whisper
Whisper

And I can smell destruction's spark
Careening towards a speeding car
Driver and rider and the same -
All up in flames
Up in flames - flames

I stumble down stagnation's path
Resisting change's dying gasp
Immersed in squalor, the sky descends
Grey is the color - your only friend

Lips sewn shut, no need to speak;
Comprehension obsolete
The images feed,
The hungry lies grow fat and strong
Don't want to belong -
In this world of lies
Don't want to belong...

Every time I do, it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?

And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneakin' out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times

I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in

Oh oh oh
Oh God I, I

I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Goodbye

Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down

We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we'd know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel

Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when

Oh oh oh
Oh God I, I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it

Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it

I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it

If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door

Mannie: Yeah, Yeah, Yeah...
Baby: (Big Diamonds... Big Tymers...)
Mannie: Yeah, yeah...

Mannie (of Big Tymers):
I put 'Cris stains on private planes, 'cause it's my jet,
Nigga, money ain't shit cause my rottweilers drink 'Moet.
Diamond baugette bracelets... for my lovers...
Playa, I use 'Cristal to lubricate rubbers...
Who got, shit on his wrist that cost three nickel?
Who got, the project on lock when that nigga slangin' pickle?
Who got a, benz, a prowler--playboy--and a 'Vette...
Tell the truth, who fucked ya' on the same night when we met?
Now, who got baby mama's from N.O. to New York?
Who got, every bitch attention in this muthafucka' when he talk?
Now who the fuck we talkin' bout, look--Y'all don't know?
I'll give you a hint... See that bitch you with? He fucked that ho.
Now look here, y'all ain't seen my watch? It's like Harlem World video,
White diamonds, red rubies, blue baugettes, I don't know...
Shorty, whens the next time I'm'a be up in your bed,
I love you? You love me? Well go head on, and give me some head...

Juvenile: (Chorus 2x)
Loud pipes, Big rims,
Whodi, that's our life...
When we pull up at the club,
Sorry, that's our night...
I know a lot of haters out there,
Sayin', that that's not right...
But our diamonds are much bigger,
So, that's our life...

Baby (of Big Tymers): No doubt, Juve'! Lah-lah...
I told Sol, ""I need somethin' with some hell of a ice,"" (Ice...)
Nigga came back with a hell of a price... (Price...)
That ain't nothin', these ho's doin' hell'a wrong... (Violatin')
Callin' these niggas on our cell phone, (Violatin')
Bitch ridin' Benz on twenty-inch chrome, (Chrome..)
Gimme the key, the car ho, and the alarm... (All my shit..)
For my Prowler, my Jag, my Benz and my home, (Give it here...)
Bitch, you'll never ride twenty-inch chrome... (Neva' Neva' Neva')
I love to shine, that's why the choppa's mine, (Mine...)
Hit my block in my Benz, ho, with stretch tires, (Tires...)
Bought a new car that I couldn't drive, (Drive...)
Brought it to 'Tunes before a nigga could sign, (Sign right here...)
Now put the Bose system right behind my eyes, (Eyes...)
With the VC's and TV's, so a nigga could shine... (Shine...)
Let my ice **Bling Bling** like a nine to five, (Five...)
And tell all my ho's, they don't need no job (No job, whodi...)

Juvenile: (Chorus 2x)

BG: I ride the best...
From a Benz, to a Jag, to a Beamer, to a Lex,
Might fly first class on Delta, helicopter, or a jet,
I'm a stunna, I'm a reppa, G'zy like to shine,
Drink Don, Moet, and Crissy, that's the finest wine,
Twenty inches is the only thing I'll sit my shit on,
Don't bring ya' bitch around me, cause my dick she'll wanna sit on,
And I ain't gon' tell her nothin' different, that's ya issha, (Issue..)
But after she come back, your best out is not to kiss her,
Ho's sick, sayin' damn, look at Fresh pinky ring,
Look at BG watch, that bitch bling-aling-aling...
I'm a ice wearer, trust me, you will never,
See me sportin' nothin' that ain't 20 G's or betta,
Me and Wayne take the left, Juvy and Baby take the right,
It's dark in the room, we hold up our watches and it's light,
Cash Money Millionaires livin' a hell of a life,
Like my nigga Weezy said, ""Surrounded by iceee...""

Juvenile: (Chorus 2x)

Lil Wayne: Whoa... Whoa... Whoa...
Now, I'm shinin, beamin, glossin, Big Tymin, stuntin, and flossin...
Lamborghini sit on broaders, with two more in my garages...
Plus, a blue and black Ferrari, with Nintendo and Atari,
Man, I swear the car is awesome... Vroom! Sorry, we lost 'em...
I'm back, I pull up smellin' like dimesacks and 'Conyac...
I leave in a Hummer, hour lata' I'm flyin' back,
Sshhhhh... private jet's about to land,
The women fall out when I let 'em touch my hand,
I get out the plane into a Mercedes-Benz van,
TV's all over with chrome twenty-inch fans,
Damn... God - damn... Man - I am... L-I-L... Weezy, off the heezy...
But still and all, ice floodin' out my watch,
And in my grill and all, Porche Box', run blocks,
SKRRT! Peelin' off, Me and Slim in a Rover,
Beatrice... Brick holder, Cash Money young soldier... Whoa!

Juvenile: (Chorus 3x)

Grabbing at angels when I fall
'Cause I am more than this idle

Hide myself from it all
While every fear is screaming
Night into dawn

In order to attain fulfillment

Y'all rock the same style (sound of the mic)

This is the way it's supposed to be

It's supposed to be about our families
It's supposed to be about avoiding catastrophe
But it's all about salary and flattery
Distrust, lust, hate and tragedy
It's supposed to be about you and me on the same route
Were you there in eighty-six when I first came out?
And you know about how they runnin' this game out
It's supposed to be about fun and getting' the pain out
But it's all about clout and poppin' them chains out
Instead of forgiveness, we poppin' they brains out
It's supposed to be about seekin' in the seek out
You witnessin' injustice, you got to speak out
If you claimin' you love this, you got to release doubt
Knowledge is what I'm all about

Well it's supposed to be sunlight over me
Light over you, not you runnin' over me

A Hiphop guild&#243;we got to begin buildin' 'em
It's supposed to be NO police brutality
And the fact that we tolerate that crap is insanity
It's supposed to be museums and archives
Where people can see the importance of OUR lives
But it ain't about any of this
Cats are trying to get that diamond-studded Rolex on they wrist
You hear a voice in the wilderness&#243;you know it's Kris
Higher consciousness lyrics, they will persist
But it's supposed to be about makin' it better
You see, Hiphop's not a product like pants or sweater
Go ahead&#243;be a hero, get your cheddar
Even y'all gonna see when you look back you remember that

You doin' your part, THAT'S how it's supposed to be
Pursuin' your art, THAT'S how it's supposed to be

It shouldn't be about you movin' slowly
Then talkin' junk when you don't even know me

When your life's sum-total's made
And you set your wealth in Godly deeds
Against the sins you've laid.
And you place your final burden
On your hard-pressed next of kin:
Send the chamber-pot back down the line
To be filled up again.

And the hard-headed miracle worker
Who bathes his hands in blood,
Will welcome you to the final nod
And cover you with mud.
And he'll say, ""You really should make the deal,""
As he offers round the hat.
""You'd better lick two fingers clean
He'll thank you all for that.""
As you slip on the greasy platform,
And you land upon your back,
You make a wish and you wipe your nose upon the railway track.
While the high-strung locomotive,
With furnace burning bright,
Lumbers on
You wave goodbye
And the sparks fade into night.

And as you join the Good Ship Earth,
And you mingle with the dust
You'd better leave your underpants
With someone you can trust.
And when the Old Man with the telescope
Cuts the final strand
You'd better lick two fingers clean,
Before you shake his hand.

And the hours turned to rust

And the years turned into forevermore

Please just go with me

Display your misery
This behavior is worn
The contract is torn
So just let me be

We're flying along
Sitting hand and hand
A letter folded into a paper airplane
This is how we started
And you told me not to worry
This is how I feel about you still

You tear me to pieces paper girl
Whenever your wind blows
Through my fragile paper world
And I've signed your dotted line

You've ripped me to pieces... to pieces

Sometimes even more than us.

(Lil' Flip)
There's 8 rulez... on the streets
You live by this, you won't get caught up

1-Don't eva let a nigga know yo business
2-Always start what you finish
3-Stay on yo note don't slip
4-Be careful cause these streets are a trip
5-Always keep a glock in yo whip
6-Real niggaz stick to tha script
7-Don't slang crack where you stay
8-Just don't do it okay

(Lil Flip)
In my hood all you see is dope fiends and dope dealers
Rats and roaches police and 4 wheelers
Metro pawn shops liquar stores
30-year-old men chillin' drinkin' mikalobe
Stop signs but don't nobody ever stop
There's ten groups in my hood but don't nobody drop
Plus the block is hot
And this dope game cold
Through rain sleet or snow birds gotta get sold

(Big Shasta)
Birds get sold
I stand and watch the game unfold.
Thangs git throwed.
I told my connect rain or snow
Exchange the doe,
Leave the scene wit no clue.
4 words you gotta remember don't brake the rulez
Use your tool

(Lil Flip)
Its kinda like you move you loose

(Big Shasta)
If you don't fuck wit me I ain't fuckin' wit you

(Lil Flip)
Respect the game when you see my weapons aim nigga I ain't a rookie I'm a vetren mane.

(Lil' Flip)
Hustle for yo wealth, stack benjamins.
Buy it, cook, cut it, whip it, ship it, then I'm in the wind
Back to home base I'm on a paper chase
I'm not a case catcher so I can't catch a case
Money on my mind. And how am I gonna get it
I dress like I'm broke but I'm really running the city
Bricks turn into crums
Gallons turn into one
Drugs violence distrubuting narcotics using guns
Money, cash, hoes
Swang it, glass full
Get the dope, pay the bills, man that's all I know
Hustlers never sleep, and sleepers never hustle,
Down the interstate with a brick in my muffler,
Keep it on a low, cause niggas be snitchin,
They'll do anything so they won't see prison,
Man you never know, yo brother can be a snitch,
And a month later now you got undercovers checking yo piss,
I'm off the block
Somebody better call the cops
I'm hallin rocks
Somebody better call the doc
I'm shippin and handling
When I'm not chicken dismaniling
The family don't feed me I feed the family.

349,"Now let's talk about self expression, true expression
Open your minds without question
No doubt, tell me what you're thinking about
Let's try to set aside pride and clout
Can you believe I feel the same exact way you do?
You truly do believe these modern ways have fooled you
Systems exist so we never meet each other
Pretty soon from now that I'll long the word ""brother""
And that's true if they see you walking with a crew
If you don't know, that means more than two
I'll tell you what they'll do
They'll pull over, hunt you over
Kick your ass, nightstick to your shoulder
I know it's unjust, as if it wasn't enough
If you try to fight back they're locking your ass up
And Chuck already told you that a cell is hell
But I'm waiting for the phone so I'll sit for a spell
Call the guard, tell him I'm a piece of God
With no beliefs in his streets or his boulevards
I eat, read so my mental is hard
And the heat from my anger just melted the bars
They reach for their guns so I put them to sleep
Break the chains and put the shoes back on my feet
He's on the loose with no discernible scars or marks
Just the mind of Mandela and the heart of Rosa Parks
So I dip, time to see the governor and mayor
Tell them life ain't fair and see if they care
Well they do, but only if they are the heir
So they appear to have a heart and make a flair
But they haven't done shit for us and that's a fact
Their only function is to keep the funny money where it's at
And it causes pain, stress
Ask me if we need a different way of life (yes)

Headline: Bush steals the presidency
He needs the backing of the media what could the remedy be?
The country's headed for recession reminiscent of the Great Depression
Are lives worth a world of power? Easy question
Planes hit the towers and the Pentagon
Killing those the government wasn't dependant on
It's easy to control the scared so they keep us in fear
With their favorite Middle Eastern demon named Bin Laden this year
Bush disguises blood lust as patriotism
Convincing the living to love ""Operation Let's Get 'Em""
But when he realized we don't support their attacks
They needed something to distract, hmm, anthrax
This further demonizes Afghanis
So Americans cheer while we kill their innocent families
And what better place to start a war
To build a pipeline to get the oil that they had wanted before
America supported the Taliban
To get Russia out of Afghanistan
That's how they got the arms in
They're in a war against the Northern Alliance
And we can't build a pipeline in hostile environments
Here's what your history books won't show:
You're a dead man for fucking with American dough
They killed several birds with one stone
While you're at home with anti-terrorism up in your dome
But my eyes are wide open and my TV is off
Great, 'cause I save on my electricity cost
And you can wave that piece of shit flag if you dare
But they killed us because we've been killing them for years

(Music and Lyrics by D.Gildenlow)

Through a dusty window I watch the clouds draw near
A lovely vision of my doom
The sunlight's fading - reflections start to dim
Through the dusty window in this room

I'm walking through my memories as I'm staring through the glass
I have to claim I'm innocent
Though I can't remember what I've done these past few nights
I can't be the one that Father Kane believes I am

I see myself now, in the dusty glass
All wired up in this chair
My face is foreign and my weary eyes are black
I see myself through that stare

Eternal alleys that lead to walls hidden behind unlocked doors
I claim the handle, I need to see
Even though I'll surely be afraid of what I may find...

...Beyond the mirror!
(Inside the circle)

I walk through mazes of cold corridors
Searching for the core of my mind
My heartbeats reach out to find another pulse
That once was bound and confined

The two different heartbeats, becoming one
Are causing the coalescence of my soul
A quiet outcry - a silent scream - is filling me as I am driven back
From shadows that dwell...

...Beyond the mirror!
(Inside the circle)

(Hallgren/D.Gildenlow/Both/Hallgren/D.Gildenlow/Both)

My world is frozen as I'm staring through the glass
Gazing through the window at my memories
Not longer foreign
Though I somehow wish... they were

The glowing fingers of a violent raging sky
In search for evil find a path
They rush through my veins, they invite my pulse to die
They end my life with frenzied wrath

Amidst the shadows of whisper land
I feel that something's binding me to life
Confined in nowhere by no one's hand
I realize the pact is unfulfilled
I'm trapped on the edge...

...Beyond the mirror!
(Inside the circle)

The girl be cooking and cleaning and cleaning and cooking
She be constantly douching and cleaning her pussy
And when she step on the scene everybody be looking
And to get in them jeans everybody be wishing
But she only want players who far from rookie
And if you ain't got the cake
Can't play with the nookie
Her titties sitting pretty and she soft as a cushion
If you try to holla she might holla she tooken
And she walk like a bad bitch talk like a bad bitch
And go and get her hair and shit fixed is a habit
Now bad bitch go and buy fish more than average
And bad bitches get to take trips with the savage
Can never tell a bad bitch a freak she too classy
But shit I can tell from her lips that she nasty
Expensive ass pant-ses grip to them asses
She mean as a pitbull sweet like cabbage

Caress the bad bitch now the girl gon wild

Then freak it up and beat it up and that's my style
You get alot of head when your bread in piles

A trifling ass bitch make the big dog growl
A bad ass bitch make the big dog proud
Which one is the baddest
That's the one I'm having
The with no kids or just one baby daddy
And she ain't hard-headed
Can listen and respect it
And you ain't a bad bitch if you got bad credit
A thong and press-ons and know how to cook neckbones
I want the MVP with that throwback dress on
Don't like to get dirty and don't mind working
And she don't mind giving me some mouth and lip service

I'm sure I've seen this look before
Done a thousand times and a million more
How many lies did he tell this time?
How many times did he cross the line?
It won't help me but I have to ask
Is there something real that's behind the mask?
Something true we don't know about?
A little faith in amongst the doubt

And maybe someday you will grow
Maybe someday you will know
Maybe someday you will end these tears and go

A little piece of me grows old
I keep on walking down this road
I've seen a million people change
But I will stay the same
And I know you (Know you, know you)
Always steal and borrow
And I know you (Know you, know you)
Never catch, you're never gonna catch tomorrow

I'm sure I've played this scene before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
I'm sure I used to hold your hand
Did I hurt you?
All this attitude with no history
All this anger when you're attacking me
Got a lot to learn and you need to know
That your time is up kid, let it go

Maybe someday you will grow
Maybe someday you will know
Maybe someday you will end these tears and go

But this has gotta stop
Good shoes won't save you this time

Sound the blows to the forehead from the
Mock, mock, mock
Of the words, a voice I hear every morning

Stalking me from yesterday
The taunts of one who sought to frame
The picture of this desolate
This figure cowering

Every word a double edged sword
A double edged sword
My every word

Drop, drop, drop
Sound the sledge to the metal
Shot, shot, shot
Sound the pin to the chamber
My own words pound after me
Intentions bent on conquering
The very will I proudly claimed
Was the very axe that cut the nape

Every word a double edged sword
A double edged sword
My every word

(I'll never, ever look back
All the time it was me
Sitting still, sitting still
Arrogant mindset of lusts
They search and strain and drink and stagger
When we are hollow
Sitting still, sitting still
You hate us 'cause we'll never go away)

""You can drown
In your own mistakes
Burrowing into the black
Or you can take my hand""

Double
Edged
Sword
My every word

""This gift was never yours
So why would you ever think
The words you said were your own?
I have chosen
And breathed
And forgiven
And changed
Purged
And cleaned
And forgave
And bathed
Carried
And soothed
And burned
And spoken
Spoken and spoken
Spoken and spoken
Spoken and spoken...

Yours is not to proclaim... but only to obey.""

Call Vegas casino, the top cat with the dark blue Cadillac
Up to Reno from there

The {?} high rock, smokin' blunts of green
Miami hoes in the house, G-strings and thongs
Chicago pimps get paid when the record's on
Rough - see me do my thing
We're Detroit boss players with them pinky ringers
Rinky-dink cheap whores without chips ain't jack
See the roof is on fire and the party is packed
Shake and bake and take the time to make a rhyme

Sailing on a dollar sign across the seven seas
The banner is white, blue, and red
The locust's flight to swarm the dead
A buzzing plague to cage the lost
The spreading web breeds holocaust
The Third World's in your sweaty hands
You bleed 'em dry and rape their lands
You loan 'em cash to kill their soils
White bureaucrats divide the spoils

Swirling red and blue lights flash upon the housing walls
My back against the lockless doors of countless bathroom stalls
Sifting through a puzzled life until the pieces click
Wading through America-the hate, the lies, the sick

(I'm) spittin' at the flag you wave
(I'm) pityin' the life the life you gave
The propaganda zombifies
To stuff your head with hateful lies
(And) violence really keeps the peace
All across the Middle East
With diligence, we scorch the soil
And siphon out their precious oil

All these patriotic lies oft sicken me to wake
How much shit and disrespect are we supposed to take
While you chant amongst the bleachers, ""USA is number one!""
We'll cheer the empire crumbling down to rot beneath the sun

We have to be the winning team
Democracy's a dying dream
And everything is classified
To keep our terror justified
We have to keep our engines filled
So what if foreign blood is spilled?
I'm blind to the reality
If the media lies, it's news to me

This is what you're proud of when you have your little flag
A sovereign nation brutalizing a wetted paper bag

And all the worlds a cage
We're locked upon the stage

(In a) Capitalist society
We're threatened by autonomy
Their labor must belong to us
In cash and greed and God we trust
(It's) just another policy
To cripple their economy
Bury them in endless debt
To the World Bank and the IMF
(So) I'm burnin' up the flag you wave
I'm dancin' on your fuckin' grave
You're sellin' devastating death
You're suckin' souls and robin' breath
And your greed's a blasphemy
You're profitin' from misery
Where will all this madness end?
When the money burns and cities rend

(The Rain)
A golden sunset in darkest night
It melts the skin and blinds the sight
A fungal cloud of blackened ash
The rain floods down to spark the rash
Into your mind, the sickness bores
While underground, they lock the doors
You glide into abysmal deep
Escape, escape, to sleep

In our Lady of Immaculate Dawn
Could have got married in the revival man's tent
But there ain't no reviving what's gone
Slipped like a shadow from the family he made
In a little white house by the woods
Dropped the kids at the mission, with a rose for the virgin
She knew he was gone for good

It's a long way to Heaven, it's closer to Harrisburg
And that's still a long way from the place where we are
And if evil exists, it's a pair of train tracks
And the devil is a railroad car

Could have stayed somewhere but the train tracks kept going
And it seems like they always left soon
And the wolves that he ran with moaned low and painful
Sang sad miseries to the moon

It's a long way to Heaven, it's closer to Harrisburg
And that's still a long way from the place where we are
And if evil exists, it's a pair of train tracks
And the devil is a railroad car

Rose at the altar withered and wilted
Romero sank into a dream
He didn't make Heaven, he didn't make Harrisburg
He died in a hole in between

Others say God's a drunkard for pain

Was burned to make way for a train

And bust it open like I'm bout to get burnt in here

Just lay back 'cause I'm on a mission to please
And I got plenty doe whodie so I ain't lookin' for cheese
Not tonight I got a quarter pound of that weed
And we can go to the verge, come one put it all in me

Wake up alone by 2 in the morn' like damn, Hagon
Careful what you ask for cause you just might get it
And once I came would you swallow or spit it
I know you freaky you don't have to admit it
I take 'em petite, or thick in the thighs
I like to fuck 'em while I look in they eyes
So go on, cut up, girl toot your butt up and do your thang
Sad but I knew your pussy before I knew your name

It turns you out in the night;

If you don't believe it
Then lose yourself and feel it;
This is the bright frontier
Right now, right here;
This is the bright frontier
Right now, right here.

Taking hold of what we have,
It's easy now;
We're splitting it open
To eat the seeds.
Looking in at what we've found,
It's easy now;
This big horizon,
It's you and me.

If you don't believe it
Then lose yourself and feel it;
This is the bright frontier
Where the love runs free;
This is the bright frontier
The sky is the limit for you and me.

Or 106 and Park, with AJ and Free
Or MTV, come take a look at my house
And after that, come take a look at my mouth
Yeah I represent the South, like Pastor Troy
And I'm still Fresh and Clean, like Andre and Big Boi
But hold up! You better get your own style
'Cause we been talkin' shit on TV for a while!
Now when you see me with a sweet, blowing smoke out my nose
9 times outta 10, I'm probably blowin' Hydro
So don't blow my high, just leave me alone!
'Cause I get high like Cheech and Chong
Call me 'Afroman' when my hair ain't braided
I got 20 tattoo's but I'm still educated
But hold up! You better get your own style
'Cause we been smokin' high-time weed for a while!
And when you see my at the club, I gotta get my floss on
Techno, my ring shinnin, and I got my cross on
I gotta brand new phone, 'Cause I'ma rich nigga
And when people call, you can see they picture
I'm still Lil'Flipper, but my money got taller
And my Benz got wider, and your hundred got smaller
But hold up! You better get your own style
'Cause we been acting bad, drivin' cars for a while!
When you see me Big Pimpin', like UGK
I'm choppin on blades, candy-paint, Jog Grey
I'm sittin' on Twenty's, but I'm twenty-one
I'm ridin' with an AK, you still got a B-B Gun
So you need to Back, Back, and gimme 50 feet
Cause you ain't sellin records like Sucka-Free
But hold up! You better get your own style
'Cause we been ridin' around with straps for a while!

Because we represent the 7-1-3!
The type of Rappers y'all never goin' be!
We makin' money y'all never goin' see!
Because we represent the 7-1-3!

Y'know when advice is in your face, you need to heed that
Word, you need to read that
Y'know, I put this lil' joint together real quick
You know what it's called?
It's called - NOW YOU'RE FUCKED!
That's right, listen

(Verse One)
Wasn't you the type to mimic what you saw on TV?
Wasn't you the type to mimic what you heard on CD?
You never wanted to work you wanted everything easy
You heard KRS and you said, ""That's preachy!""
A wise young man says, ""Father - teach me""
A foolish young man wants to live life freaky
Oh yes, Knowledge does Reign Supremely
When I said it eighty-nine you didn't believe me

NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... that's right
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... life is over, finished, done
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... better heed that, read that
Now you're fucked!

Listen - back in the days on the Boulevard of Linden
BROOKLYN! Kris was a, metaphysician
LOOKIN'! For better ways to live without bein
TOOKEN! We started our own management and
BOOKIN! Makin' moves with them live cats on
FULTON! I can't even 'member all the dough that we
TOOK IN! But you was lookin' down on us
Cause platinum never astounded us, so

NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... word, like that
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... ha, you shoulda heed that, you better
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... y'all was chasin the radio, remember that?
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... what they givin' you back now?

(Verse Three)
Back when we was all singin' ""Monie in the Middle""
You wanted to wiggle, jiggle in a tight skirt and giggle
Even when outside was brittle, you still had on little
And KRS warned that you'll get played like a fiddle
Now you havin' cravings for pickles cause you pregnant
And don't know where the dad went and you poppin' them drugs like Skittles
When the baby is born it's little and sick
But it's no riddle, you was movin too quick, huh

NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... word, look at this
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... you shoulda stayed home and read a book
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... literally, symbolically
Now you're fucked!

(Verse Four)
When advice is in your life you need to take it
Cause frankly, everybody ain't gonna make it
Back in the days we, showed 'em the way
I put it there in the music but you weren't amazed
You would criticize, debate, and basically hate
But let it be known I wanted everyone to be great
But you would diss and not even try to do better
When we was at the U.N. you said ""whatever""

NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... word
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... we movin ahead, you still in the same spot
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... 'member all that back talk, all that?

Pretend I'm not up here, I try counting sheep
But the sheep seem to shower off this office tower
It's 9.8 straight down, I can't stop my knees

I wish I could fly
From this building, from this wall
And if I should try
Would you catch me, if I fall?

My hands clench the squeegee, my secular rosary
Hang on to your wallet, hang on to your rings
Can't look below me, or something will throw me
I curse at the windstorms that October brings

I look straight in the boardroom, a modern Pharaoh's tomb
I'd gladly swap places, if they care to dive
They're lined up at the window, peer down into limbo
They're frightened of jumping, in case they survive

I wish I could step from this scaffold
Onto soft green pastures, shopping malls, or bed
With my family, and my pastor, and my grandfather who's dead

Look straight in the mirror, watch it come clearer
I look like a painter, behind all the grease
But painting's creating, and I'm just erasing
A crystal-clear canvas is my masterpiece

From this building, from this wall

Would you catch me, if I fall?

Through life, things I've done wrong, and do right
I had a few nights, of comin' in drunk, fightin' with punks
At club, writin' to front, stomp it with gloves

Head to the lab, grab my pen and my pad, feel the wind draft
Dump the insensce ash inside the hour glass

Watchin' the secret sands, remind me the extinction of man
If we don't unite, I'll think of plans

See cats on the train beggin' for change
Need medicine for they pain, I'm in heavy rain
Sweat testin' my aim, carve in my bullets with the president's name
Destined to reign, feel guns bust while cats discuss
About the gats they bust, and loyalty among employees
The more weed, the more they mind's stay freed
The more the nines get squeezed, the more the crime leads
The more they blind me, push that light far behind me
I sought ashanti's and monks in the hills, I dwelled months for real
No deal, but still hold the steel
Sometimes I spaz out, pull my pad out
Then my pad sprouts to a crackhouse, filled with drug dealers

402,"Earthcrusher

At last, the day of the blast
Disaster, welcome to the hereafter
Government powers in conflict
In a world gone sick
And they're heavily equipped
With arms to melt down cities and farms
The final stage witness the force of pure rage
While we were all at work
Trying to earn a wage
The targets are on lock
They're ready to engage
Finally to put to use all of those years of bomb testing
And biological questing
For better ways to destroy and torment
Now let's feel what we've chosen to invent
Blast off! Everybody stand clear
Missiles are in the air to sever and sear
Thugs, executives and cops with tazers
Trees are dust, skyscrapers are vapors
I'mpact! Now nothing is intact
Take cover, we're under attack
Delivering oblivion, one already hit
But look out, here comes another
Earthcrusher!

"".
This is what we always feared could happen
But never dreamed it would
Nuclear holocaust
Already hit China, Korea
Next destination: Japan""

Napalm scorched your backs
And you ask where your tax dollars went to
So now they have sent you
A demonstration, devastation
Four billion degrees of presentation
Courtesy of some major corporations
You might have had stock in
But money can't stop the toxin
They crippled your frame while you were walking
Now your mouths frothing
Inhale, poison has replaced oxygen
Your heart contracts, aorta snaps
Lungs collapse
Fluid exiled of urinary tracts
In this atmosphere to which nobody adapts
No more petty crimes, nickel sacks
Rap shows or raves
Sunshine and bullshit holidays
Just radiation and tidal waves
Death to the modern day slaves
Running down the street with our arms raised
Atheists now give praise
The sounds of nuclear bombs
Whistle right past my ear
Headed towards Zaire
Many have died, but you better believe
That more are bound to suffer
Earthcrusher!

"". 52 seconds since the last attack
Nearly a quarter of the earth's population wiped out
Added to the list of countries hit: Africa, West. uh, yo
I really don't know what's going to happen""

We support this through silence and complacency
While our government ruled the world under masonry
Made every nation regret their adjacency
Brutal hostility, now we're facing the
Worst burst of energy ever unleashed
I could have sworn I heard them say that they wanted peace
A quarter of the population is fully deceased
It's gotta cease, blood rush, my anger increase
Force, with no remorse
They need diffusion, knock 'em off course
About to unleash my own brand of holocaust
Gimme an ear mic, I'll start the air strike
Aimed at those who chose to
Sacrifice our lives 'cause they're uncivilized
Surprise! Headed for the center of your eyes
Forty thousand megatons from my lungs
*Whew*
My attack is stunning
Where the fuck are you running?
Incoming! World wide assault
I take out the US Government and then Russia
Earthcrusher!

""This just in, uh. New Zealand hit. Australia

This is a sad song, about tigers.

(Carolyn:)
Let's champion the tigers.

(Neko:)
Let's champion the tiger 'cause.
You know, I think that maybe I wrote this song for many reasons
But I was telling them earlier, I was in a cab in Toronto the other day
And the CBC was on and they were talking to a lady
Who specializes in animal husbandry
And she takes care of the tigers at The Toronto Zoo.
And they said ""Well do you ever reintroduce the tigers?""
And she goes ""Well, no, because their habitat can't sustain them.""
And immediately I thought to myself
'There's so many extra children, we could just feed the children, to these tigers.'
We don't need them. We're not doing anything with them.
Tigers are, tigers are...

(Carolyn:)
Noble!

(Male voice:)
Hungry!

(Neko:)
Noble, and sleek
Children are loud and messy
I was one of those children
If I were to become tiger food
It would've been more noble than

(Carolyn:)
Heavy!

Probably ruined the song for you now
But we'll still play it for you anyway

Fall foul of the masses

The date - summer, August 25th
You was transferred from Riker's Island to Attica State Prison
Gina, Thompson

I told you you shouldn'ta went out there with those other girls
And stole a coach bag out of Macy's
Arguin with me every night, you was crazy
Callin your grandmother sayin' I beat you, you think I'm mental and crazy
That Benz you pulled up you stole you didn't faze me
You had a nice body with bikers
Inmates and female C.O.'s was lookin' at your body at Riker's
I took time to write you a letter
But you wanted me to put dope in your sweater
I thought you was sick, with the flu, did you get any better?
Did you write back your Auntie Trineta? Floss and don't pay
Jack say he seen you with a drug dealer that day
You woulda been better off takin' the subway

My girl's in jail for life, never comin' home - never comin' home
She got to pay the price

You got too big in New York
You needed big hustlers around everywhere you walk
A lot of Cristal, fake ballers poppin' corks
Now you in a two-inch cell, eatin eggs and pork
Friday the 13th, your birthday, the worst day
I still had love for your dumb ass anyway
Bentleys and Rolls Royces
The answering machine filled up with mysterious voices
Your moms Ms. Jones called, I was in the mall, she said,
""Keith - Tina and Terry got them fake credit cards.
They got my daughter out there - I ain't seen Gina in two weeks.""
I hung up the phone
I knew you was workin with some bronze pimp in the streets
(Pimp in the streets... pimp in the streets)

My girl's in jail for life, never comin' home - never comin' home
She got to pay the price

(Kool Keith)
I called the operator to block the calls and stop the calls
The ceiling in my apartment was leakin like Niagara Falls
Sendin you a bunch of money, clothes and munchin money
You got a lot of phone call threats from a girl named Sunny
I seen the chick from the back
Puerto Rican girl with a nice ass drivin' a black Cadillac
With a guy with long sideburns, is that your mack?
(Is that your mack... is that your mack)

My girl's in jail for life - you're a bad girl - never comin' home
She got to pay the price - you're a bad girl...

Deep inside the hive
Hellish dungeon filled with undead
Their rotting claws reaching for my
Legs I hang above the ghouls
I know they want me for their food
Overwhelmed by deadly fear
Hung above the zombie lair

Hanging by a thread above them
Taken here to die
Rotting hands reaching for me
Their undead eyes see me as a meal
They want to eat alive
Mindless hunger in their eyes
Filthy claws grasp at my feet
Slashing wounds my ankles bleed

Pit of zombies
Chasm teeming with undead
Death is grisly
Lowered slightly now they reach me
I scream in frantic pain
Tearing off my feet with fury
The pain intense below my knees my
Legs have been removed
They suck the blood from the wounds
Voracious zombies rend my thighs
They pull me down, my corpse they
Will divide

Pit of zombies
Chasm teeming with undead
Their jaws await me
A gruesome end the
Pit of zombies
Reanimated to devour
I watch them kill me

They claw at my face
And rip off my scalp
Exposing my skull
Arteries severed
Gushing blood showers them drives
Them mad raging mob
A hideous feast

Puncture my stomach and
Tear out the guts
Devour entrails
Rotting zombies have torn me apart
They gorge on my flesh

Engulfed
Consumed
This pit
My doom

Engulfed alive
Consumed by death
This pit of zombies
My doom is here

Chasm teeming with undead
Their jaws await me
A gruesome end the pit of zombies

I guess it's been about a year by now
Cold and rainy, in a poet's words
Dark and crimson in a drunken sway

I was frozen in a windowpane
Kind of like I was on a movie screen
Your hair was darker than I remembered it
I was as awkward as I could have been

So much has changed, it seems nothing ever changes
I found a way to wear a thousand different faces

Time creeps into my dreams
Breathe deep, fill your lungs with me

Headaches, stalemates 
Chest pains, I'm trembling
Ink stains, text to burn
Am I leaving, am I leaving?

I found your face in my dreams the last two nights
What are you doing there? What am I singing for?

A window sitter, grown into the crutch
The crutch has always been right there for him
I'm sorry, I'm pushing her away
I'm dark and crimson in a drunken sway

So much has changed, it seems nothing ever changes

Sets his mind to the task at hand
But he knows first he&#25251;l have to beat their fence.
So he goes, drops right in,
Just as the guards come closing in &#24966;ound him.
Send him back to the drawing board again
He&#25251;l have to be more punk next year.
With nothing to show for it all, but his hand
Punk enough next year
With nothing to show for it all but a gimpy hand.

Believing in the lies, you try to rationalize what you feel

When the trumpets sound the dead will rise
We'll de called up in the skies to see heavens gates standing tall
But when you hear Him call your name, will you be able to proclaim
In my Lord of all

Bring forth the royal diadem and crown Him Lord of all

Staring at the stars 
Hope lies in the shadows 
I wonder where you are 
Are you listening for my voice 
I feel you so close yet you're far away 

Sing for me one more song 
Play for me one more time 
I can feel you though you're not here 
Your voice whispers in the breeze and you are near 

Through everything around me I find comfort in you 
Through trials and the heartache 
Your words, they speak the truth 
Lay me down to sleep now, you'll still be on my mind 
If I die before I wake, you'd still see through the lines 

Sing for me one more song 
Play for me one more time 
I can feel you though you're not here 
Your voice whispers in the breeze and you are near 
To me 

I've been ripped out 
Cut short 
Stopped within my tracks 
I've been tied down 
Turned 'round 
Learned to face the facts 
I was nothing 
Now something 
You're everything to me 
Don't go 
Please stay 
You're all that I need 

Sing for me one more song 
Play for me one more time 
I can feel you though you're not here 
You whisper in the breeze and you are near

You were just on my mind
Do you remember me?

This life is not easy
The one thing that can please me
The memory of me and my friends
Kicking round your shore

New Brighton Promenade
It's 1983
For ever on the place
Whether I choose to be

And time has passed quickly
The years have been kind to me
The memories go with my friends
Will always be around

You still exist inside my head 
There's no such thing as being dead
When somebody keeps your ghost inside
And if you looked inside my head you wouldn't 
Find a mind instead

2000, mixing it up, Chevis Camp, what

(Big Pokey)
H-Town is the place, and you better respect it
Where G's get dissected, my corner's infected
Teflon bullet blockers, keep chest protected
Bitch niggas get crushed on, they vest neglected
These streets is hectic, I'm on top of my game
Niggas ain't waterproof, and I'm about to rain
Verbal cocaine, now they calling me cheap
These gats I pack crack hats, to settle the beef
I roll with big heaters, chrome body deleters
They turn packs of jackers, into sizzling fajitas
All bugs and mesquitos, get hit with the swallow
Take it from me, big boss in DADA
Run right through Nevada, move blast the zone
You can't see me, with your glasses on
Motorized stash spot, when I stash the chrome
And if I have to pull it out, I'ma blast you homes

(Hook: Lil' O - 2x)
You better make room, duck we bust
You bitch niggas, don't wanna fuck with us
We'll get masked up, and we'll rush your cut
And even hoes get hit man, we'll touch the slut

You never know what nigga, might want you dead
This is starving hitmen, a lot of niggas got bread
Caught him myself, put one in his head
Got away smooth, now I'm running from FED's
You never know when I retaliate, coming in dark
Was coward bitch nigga, that had no heart
Now my gun gon spark, and the world won't start
Use to be associates, the streets split us apart
Separated like a divorce couple, the more troubles
Potato over top of the nozzle, to make the sound muffle
Have your town puzzled, nobody heard it
Nobody cried, nobody cared when you got murda'd
You just a average, I send slugs through your fabric
Put him out his on my mathematics, I'll let him have it
You know how my men play, Big E and Sensei
I made hits with Pittsburgh, like Clemente

(Hook: Lil' O - 2x)

On the real G's, flex with us
We sending cooked up compressed, to broke down to dust
What good is a pie, if you can't eat the crust
And divide that motherfucker, between each of us
See a nigga like me, I'ma feed the fam
And don't give a damn, if it's green eggs and ham
Bitch niggas get slammed, trying to take what's mine
I'm the nigga with the iron in front, aimed at your blind
Side, it's something foreign sitting wide
Peeping, bout to let off and ride
That's how it is, I'm just a nigga with mad skills
Knock through the soundbox, ripping the mad real
It's states was at Bailor's gates, and mad bills
Mad deals, eleven hundred with glass wheels
Now we hitters off the lot, as is
Chevis Camp, looking like the damn deal

(Hook: Lil' O - 2x)

Watch that bitch 'cause we'll touch the slut, for real
Chevis in this motherfucker repping fo' life

Ain't nothin' changed
Still doin' wild things
Whippin' something mean
The whole shorts in the Rolls Royce is off
For sure, bouncin' the bar on my next world tour
When we hit the sick, I'm the cure
We 'bout to pop it off so wild, hit the floor
Ain't nobody botherin' you
All I'm thinkin' 'bout is clobberin' you
Immigration always sayin' I'm harboring a few
Illegal aliens
Females, mostly Latins and Israeli-ans
The top story, evening news
I'm the shit, they been deceiving you
Drop the roof on the Coupe D'Ville
Shoot to kill
Ask niggas, Duke is real
Stay lookin' for the loot to steal
He determined
Don't try to touch Bad Boy, 'cause we burnin'
I want my glory
Duke is not a joke, and I ain't got?
Everytime I grab the mic it's with the sole intent
To rip shots and give you 2OO percent
Man, I'm tired of doin' dirt
Tired of being on the the run from Wyatt Earp
Rather be somewhere in a quiet church, sayin' prayers
Not only sayin' mine, but sayin' theirs
That's cause my dawgs ain't there

The more hits we make, more money to burn
The more fame we get, niggas get concerned
It don't matter who's hot, who's out
Bad Boy is Back For Good Now

Watchin' DVDs on 5O inch screens
So cut it out, you ain't now Don Juan, please
I stay spillin' Dom on my Sean John jeans
I hit the bar, yo, it's all on me
Pop bottles, models, be all on me
You all gon' see how it's all gon' be
Front on me and see where you all gon' be
Six feet deep
When the heat seek, niggas be misty
From 155th to 11Oth Street
Harlem bound, Bad Boy, who the fuck want a problem now?

See this is the part I like right here
I like when I see everybody on the dance floor
Yeah, I see y'all, just shakin' your asses
C'mon, hold on, I need to break it down
Yeah
One time like this

Now would you clap your hands
Your hands you clap
If your girl's outta place then your girl get tapped
Niggas keep thinkin' Diddy ain't on it like that
But you never see me standing on the corner like that
Cause, I'm talented, yes I'm gifted
Never boosted, never shoplifted
Forget get the cash, the money ain't nothin'
Cause everything I talk about, you know I ain't frontin'
I rock Sean John everyday
Boutiques from France to the USA
And I make all the chips off the hits I invent
So it really doesn't matter how much I spent
Cause, I'm droppin' hits
Daily
You burn me?
Really?
Think Bad Boy been played a million times
And I don't care if niggas write a billion rhymes
Damn, we still paid!

We still paid!
Yeah, we got it made!

You could hop in when your man ain't watchin'
Give you one option, temperature's droppin'
Gettin' cold, control your soul when I'm locked in
You the type of chick that fold when you boxed in
Signals my watch and givin' you more reasons to hop in
This is a Bentley, not a Datsun
Don't confuse me with dude, I'm not him

But you could leave with the cat if you that concerned
One day you gon' actually learn
But not now cause, girl, I got tracks to burn

433,"Hoy tengo celos de la luz de tu mirada
Que aunque duermas y no brille se apodera de tu cara
Hoy tengo celos de la esquina de mi almohada
Que besa en tu boquita dormida sin tus palabras

Hoy tengo celos del azul de nuestras s&#225;banas
Que aprovechando mi ausencia en tus pechos se derrama
Hoy tengo celos de la luna lunera que se cuela en la ventana
Y mientras me mira se ba&#241;a en tu mirada

Hoy tengo celos del calor de nuestra cama
Que se enreda en tus piernas, que lo intenta y no se escapa
Y echo de menos a los luceros del alba
Ay, que saben el secreto pa pintar el cielo de &#225;mbar

Hoy tengo celos del azul de nuestras s&#225;banas
Que aprovechando mi ausencia en tus pechos se derrama
Hoy tengo celos de la luna lunera
Esa que se cuela, luna traicionera

Y cuando amanezca y vea la luz de tu mirada
Har&#233; de mis labios la mejor de tus almohadas
Y cuando mis manos sean el azul de tus s&#225;banas
Gritar&#225; celosa la luna si me ba&#241;o en tu mirada

Hoy tengo celos cuando al albor de la ma&#241;ana
Suba por fin hasta ti y me sumerja en nuestra cama

If you a thug nigga what, you poppin' slugs at snitch niggas
You ain't playing, shit you's a halt about your figgas
If you thug, forever rollin' on dubs
20 deep (?) pressin the clubs with your thugs

(K-mont)
Nigga if you a thug than youu better have tatts
And whenever I got beef than I can call you for straps
Nigga if you a thug than you all about paper
And you know there's only one way you got to deal with a hater

(Krayzie)
If you a thug
You wouldn't have been talkin' it
You would have been walkin' it
Loading up your pistol marking your target and popping it
If you a thug then what the fuck that make me?
A Krayzie... nigga y'all ain't trying to see

(Asu)
If you a thug only thing squilling will be your wills and
You was a pilling at still at whoever the fuck you wasn't feeling
Thugs know the verse, my thugs holler louder than that
You don't hear them, you heard them in niggas just follow the path

(Lareece)
If you a thug I know you ain't loving the bitch, hugging the bitch
You say you just be rubbing the clique
If you a thug you know you can't be tricking the dough
Roll up in the halls, keep eyes on your foes

(K-Mont)
(Yeah yeah yeah)

(K-Mont)
Nigga if you a thug than its bitches you lust
You know its hard to find a pritty dyme piece you trust
Nigga if you a thug than you got to get yours
You still doing your thang, but ain't no love for hores

(Krayzie)
If you a thug you don't some money to make some money
Because if you a thug, if you ain't got it you taking money
If you a thug you don't give a fuck about the judge
Doing three strikes when you living your life thug!

(ASU)
What a thug see through whatever you were trying to do
I bet a thug can show you better than a thug can tell you
Thugs stay talking, and walking, stay rolling and sparking up
Thugs stay swollen in they hearts and in they nuts

(Lareece)
If you a thug oh yeah you know you staying (?) so high
Keep your heat on your side when you ride
If you a thug see you that type of nigga that never given a fuck
Mad doggin on than niggas like what
If you a thug

(K-Mont)
If you a thug you probably fighting a case
Harrassed by the police and probably sprayed with mase
Nigga if you a thug you know the law ain't shit
You screaming fuck the police
And telling the president to eat a dick

(Krayzie)
If you a you would have been screaming this shit before we was
Is you a thug or a nigga just trying to ride the bandwagon
If you a thug you got no problem spending blood
Over the shit you love so nigga tell me
Still a thug?

(Asu)
If you a thug you wouldn't be hollering
About what you would of, could of but should of you done it
Now nigga run it on your mothafuckin stomach
Ashes and elbows cocka-doo-doo
You know how the tail goes

Can we climb this mountain? I don't know

On the back of a hurricane, that started turnin'

439,"Took a sad song of one sweet evening
I smiled and quickly turned away
It's not easy singing sad songs
But still the easiest way I have to say

So when you look into the sun
See all the things we haven't done
Oh was it better then to run
Than to spend the summer crying
Now summer cannot come anyway

I had waited for time to change her
The only change that came was over me
She pretended not to want love
I hope she was only fooling me

So when you look into the sun
Look for the pleasures nearly won
Or was it better then to run
Than to spend the summer singing
And summer could have come in a day

So if you hear my sad song singing
Remember who and what you nearly had
It's not easy singing sad songs
When you can sing the song to make me glad

So when you look into the sun
And see the words you could have sung
It's not too late, only begun
We can still make summer
Yes, summer always comes anyway

So when you look into the sun
And see the words you could have sung
It's not too late, only begun
Look into the sun

Looks like she really did you in
You're a broken hearted lover
Just tryin' to recover
You need to find a place to mend
All your time ain't necessary
But I don't wanna be a temporary thing
Gimme just half a chance

When this woman loves a man
She'll do anything she can
To keep the fire alive in your soul
And when all the chips are down
I'm still gonna be the one around
To build you up and be your friend
When this woman loves
When this woman loves a man

Don't play it cool, no don't be shy
Oh there's no need to worry
No I'm not in a hurry
So let your conscience be your guide boy
Come here and let me show you
Just how much I adore you
Let me help you understand

We can't forget about Flesh
We finna drop another bomb
We figure they can't take another rhyme
Come back off and get um with another platinum rhythm
And they won't fuck in the lab
They want to try to keep up so come on
Thirty million sold and that I'll just stay at that now what about that
Listen to the thuggish
And listen to every other rapper rap about who that come from
Talkin' Bone fell off
Say what they bust just like us
They ain't even knowin' were it came from like richer niggas
They ain't going to give it to us so we gon take it
We just come to tell you that Bone Thugs back
And we still creepin'

Get down like us
And still harmonize like the great Temptations
Sit back look back
Came in the game
Came right back (back) With no hesitation
Put up yo money honey what ever ya got we won't lose
Put up or shut up
Get slapped in front of all your dogs
And all your dudes
'Cause I'm a smarter thug all ways wanted to be a thug
What do you think
Do you think he gon do something
Don't let the money fool you
Don't let the money do you
Cause it ain't really about nothin' (nothin')
Its just so much they gon let in
Toss that we gon show you who you are messin' with
That's why I started a war in this rap game
You got to hit hard
And let them now who they dealin' with

Wickedest rhymes, wickedest rhymes

(Verse 3: Layzie Bone)
When we meet on the concrete jungle
We can do it
We can rumble
Take it to the streets
And let the whole world crumble
All I ever seen was heavy smoke in the air
Bustin' heavy shots
They just don't care
If you don't then I'm goin' to get all tha bloodiness
Niggas want peace but I know they all gon test us
The thugs commin' back to bring the thug essence
Thugs commin' back to bring back the thug blessins
For the lord where doin' to fight the wind
Imma fight to get them all hyped again
Tell the Bone Thug story again
If a nigga still hatin' a pipe again
Like I did before creep creep and I came
Just four more niggas down for there thang
Never been afraid to let my nuts hang
How to you think Bone Thug made it to the top of the game nigga

(Verse 4: Bizzy Bone)
Fully automatic loaded
Remy Martin fill my potion
Coastin' on freeways keep rollin' till we hit the ocean
Motion on freeways bout to bustin' on niggas bostion
Popi Cholos solo with my pistol so smokin'
Pullin' pop up bitch nigga if you talkin'
Tokin', tortin' with my pistol

Could I rob, no. Could I steal, no. Could I jack, no. Should I kill, no.
Nah, I gotta get my shit together, Cause a nigga need a house and big furniture

Wishin and lookin' tryna do what I do, and if you fuck with me I'll shoot or
I'll sue
And how you wanna handle business I can get it like that, And sellin work on the

Lend on
When you try to ball and your money been gone, when you try to put a down

Get your ass out them cuffs
Will your nigga take you to the mall to buy some clothes, will your nigga ever

Will your nigga buy your drink and smoke up the weed, Ride for your ass when

Come to your funeral and tell a fuckin' story, Think about the nuts that we took

That U.S. history
Was built upon the graves
Of native ways and beaten slaves

Until we misbehave
There's just no escape
From the crushing weight of the police state

Two towers falling down

Empires will always fall

Of modern-day colonialism that makes the people
Of the underdeveloped world poorer
And the multinational corporations richer
And take the power away from all of us
It's time to take back control of our lives
And tear apart these monuments to greed and build
A new world from the broken pieces

I pledge allegiance to no flag
Top the bottle with an oily rag
We're building up an army fast
To destroy the pigs and break the upper class
I'm only one; this is my voice
But you're gonna have to make a choice
I don't care if you disagree

It means the whole world to me

We won't be hypnotized
By all the media lies
This time, the truth is told
When you're sick to death 
Of being bought and sold
Our freedom's been misplaced
Fuck that, it's been erased
The world's a shooting range
I'm gonna spare some change
To uphold the stock exchange

Their skewed development policies 
Kill people every day 
And they keep us so hypnotized that 
Even though it's right in front of our eyes,
We don't see it:
World Trade is a death machine

Two towers falling down
I'll be at zero ground
We're ""flying friendly skies""

Nigga schemin'so don't wake me bitch 'cause I'm dreamin'

Cock my nine, and I'm out the window
Drunk as fuck and high off that indo
Nigga E, C-P-T, the O.G.
And I really don't think you wanna fuck with me
Nigga walkin' half up with nine in hand
I gives a mad fuck but they don't understand
I wet 'em up, wet 'em up, wet 'em up
Now back to the mutha fuckin' set, creepin' crawlin crawlin creepin'
Don't get caught sleepin'

(Layzie)
Sleepwalkin stalkin runnin' with the gauge up under this murderous spell now
Consider me hellbound, crossin my path, I'ma drop this 12-gauge shell down
On the road to destruction, gauge eruption, creepin' so I'm cautious
Catch a nigga sleep, six feet deep
And scopin out peepin cause ya be makin' me nauseous
Deeper than a ocean man, hitttin you with this potion man
Death runnin' up from the left, Bang! #1 in this murder game, insane
See a nigga fall victim, pick him, me click him, hunt on this deadly prowl
Watch out for the nightfall, when them come, mo murder be a nigga style
Mo murder, me comin' to serve ya
Judgement day, me reapin
Lil Lay on the deep end
So me flipped with a spiff and I caught them sleepin'
Eternally soldiers of the Clair, keep it ruthless, Mo Thugs
Little Layzie ya big boss, wanna floss on this
Gotta make that cheese, yeah nigga we gettin' 'em

(Krayzie)
(It's on on on) Nigga let's killa killa killa
Bodies they count, me buckin 'em down, stay down
Murder me style, me put 'em in the ground now way down
Steady flip when I bang, bang, man
Flippin I roll with me gun
Still it's itchin to bang, bang, hang
And it's all the same
They willin' to serve ya mo murder, mo murder
They thinkin' you tangle but when they get mangled
Rip all of your soldiers scream, but no body heard ya
Then pop in the clip if ya lettin me doze off, you lost
Creepin', I'm drunk when I stalk me victim
Sleepwalk with the intent to kill him
Woke up and my shovel done soaked in blood, put 'em in the mud
Don't know what it was but his gut was still drippin off me fuckin' gloves
Then I got me strapped up, straight-jacked up, but man I'll be reapin,
Creepin' up under your dome, it's seepin
When the sawed off get to creepin', fall victim

(Bizzy)
Me stalkin, chalkin up bloody victims
Rest, the Ripsta, the sinister kill a nigga
Put him in a river, bodies shiver, pump blood now
Wanna rest with the Mo Thugs, buckin 'em on down
What is it in ya, deep in the dead and we get fried
P.O.D. d when it comes to ride
Creep out your seat, but don't fall in the night
Once inside, forgettin about remorse
Tour curse'll ride, cry now when I'm ready to lie down
Then I awake in a mental state somebody gotta die now
I'll pap pap puttin' a clack back in a me gat
Not never to mention never to mention
It'll be over when I take a nap, me deadly
But then me put in the bullet, the wickedness in me
And I'm on a mission on murder roll city to city without no pity
Well I got a clique see
My niggas up out of the woods reapin
Peep me creepin' out of the corner, who just got caught sleepin'?

(Wish)
Once the Mo comes up thers gonna be murder
Killer when the night falls
And it ain't shit to kill 'cause I really don't love ya
Don't run, run, run, I like my knife
Run up with that gun, gun, gun, and take your life
Straight-jakket is loose creepin' up to get ya get ya
But fo' mo killas #1, Leatherface, that psycho and that killa Ripsta
Dippin me clip and me dumpin, me ditch ya
Thought he was dead but they saved him with stitches
When I come hard let's kill 'em all, niggas and bitches

456,"There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
When she gets there, she knows if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for

And she's buying a stairway to Heaven

There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

It makes me wonder
It makes me wonder

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

It makes me wonder
It really makes me wonder

And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May Queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

And it makes me wonder

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind, oh

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadow's taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all, yeah
To be a rock and not to roll

And she's buying a stairway to Heaven

457,"No more smiles and no more outrage
Apathy pervasive, emotions narcoleptic
No more smiles since fucking Sunday
Sinking feelings, drinking early, stinking septic

Stinking like a dream

Spoken outside in outside voices
Struck silent into shuddering and cold ground padded noises
Sucking myself up a truth that I don't need
Last nights, I don't believe

No slowing down
No faces smile, no lips that frown
Gray to neutral, every synapse, stinking thoughts, a pool of dinner
Wipe my mouth and hope to die

This street is cold, early morning noises
This body reeling, ugly early morning choices
No more drinks until fucking noon
Rotting teeth and gums, and a blackening that sets in soon

And an all revealing smile
Just falling down
Won't make these hours turn around
I wish I could remember what I'm trying to forget

You turn around instead
And try to understand the things they've said

Some might say they've found a way to heaven
And celebrate their ordinary ways
You might say you've found a way to heaven
But I don't believe in anything I've seen
In you so far

Like an unbalanced beer can two minutes too late
A look like a stale face from a fresh grave
Chip on my shoulder and an eye full of rage

Can you taste that beer with your back to the bar?
Can you smell that cigarette without letting down your guard?

Ten cans, 4 AM friends
The sad thing is that you've always been like this
Moaning in a bed shaped like a hearse
Believe the lies that you tell yourself

You tell me that my problem is thinking
I can chase it away with a problem like drinking
Well, you tell me you don't want to get old
Got a party on the line and a grave on hold

Like a drunk operator, like a game of roulette
Like a martini balanced on a whiffleball bat
When the hard wind blows, it's gonna fall down
When the wind blows there'll be broken glass all around

Can you taste that beer with your back to the bar?
Can you smell that cigarette without letting down your guard?

Ten cans, 4 AM friends

Moaning in a bed shaped like a hearse
Believe the lies that you tell yourself, things can never get worse

Can you taste that beer with your back to the bar?

East 1999 my niggas!
Think about back in the days when the year was '89. Little nigga on the grind, gotta get mine, doin' my crime with 2 in here, steady stackin' my ends, put my serve down on the Clair 9-9. Hittin' up the Graveyard Shift with Real, Little Will, Big Wally, and Wish Bone. Little Wally highrollers, and he wonder why niggas so strong. Krayzie Bone, stack, Rod J--much love, kept a nigga on his toes in the game. It's an everyday thang, when you let your nuts hang, gotta make a grand at least daily, man. Them Cleveland hustlas, never no bustas. Thug to the heartbeat of niggas from the Land fool, and the old school. Just serve out your sentence and be cool. Fuckin' with trues. Rest In Peace, little nigga Ripsta, stressed that Bone love. Smokin' on bud, 'cause a nigga Mo Thug callin' all my niggas when it's time to nut 'em. In the 9-9, haters gonna drop to the #1 with the gun, so run run. Cleveland is the city where a nigga come from, slangin' them dum-dums.

Krayzie
Niggas it's goin' down, up in the C-Town. Get 'em up with the thug (thug) and that nigga with the bud (bud). Get the fifth of Rose, but the liquor store closed and I'm all out the forty. Raise up, nigga. Burn up the buddah, smoke it all up. Nigga, don't stiff on the reefer. Mo! runnin' up outta the cut with this fresh sack of hydro, and this shit is creeper. Peep the street, bust again on Double Glock-glock with-ah-me rocks. Cops sweatin' me block. Copper better drop when the gunshot pop, blood, dumpin' the body and the bullshit stop. Whenever the trouble knocks with the po-po, niggas roll solo, split up, and swerve. Krayzie take caution. Take all my llello and tossed it. See none when they roll to the curb. Runnin', duckin', jumpin' up in the Land. My niggas, it's crazy. We slang and we buck and we bang on the Glock and my nigga, that's daily. Who the nigga with the twelve gauge? (Pump.) It's Mr. Sawed-off Leathaface, so you better pray. Eternally thugsta. East 1999 where (???).

Bizzy
Gotta give P's to them SCT's! and I roll, big thug on the Glock. Pump, blast for the cash, then I'll mash the gas, gotta dash away from them cops. Got Lil' Mo! Hart steadily flippin' off Rose.

Living in sin, bout to go back again

Got money to infiltrate, and I still ain't straight

It ain't no way for you to change, you was born a thug
You ain't ready for the war, these streets'll eat you alive

Dope fiends and crumb snatchers, that's straight riding

A nigga be dead, without his nuts and his pride
This game worldwide, I take it how it come
We living so raw, up in the city that I'm from
Each and every year, the system is start switching

We black and caught up, with nobody to blame

I've been chasing down the clock, he got me stuck up in time
Niggaz living for the fame, I want the money and power
And I promised my old man, I wouldn't be no coward
So I'm living my dream, yeah a neighborhood legend
Steaks on the plate, I ain't got time for the begging
My family is fed, with nice sheets on the bed
Artillery and surveillance, glocks with infrared
Niggaz want me dead, but I'm far from scared
'Cause I swear, I'ma come where you lay your head
'Cause I'm a outlaw nigga, catch the straight feeling

Will I ever come around or will I just hit the ground?
Will I still be standing when it all comes around?

(Why can't I) seem to sort it out?
(Why am I) always filled with doubt?

So many people everywhere, so self-absorbed without a care for their viral lives.
I'd like to bleed them all.
When all is drained, who shall hold?
When mindless bodies screw tortured souls,
Will somebody be there to catch me when I fall?

(Why am I) always filled with doubt?

I could talk bitches out of they jeans
Gold diggers out of they cream
Little wannabe rap muthafuckas out of they dreams
I'm slick, I could talk a hustler out of his fiends
I rap so hot, the water in my spit becomes steam
I'm like a pound of uncut coke when hittin' the scene
Y'all are powder particles that trickled off the triple beam
Stop trippin', little chicken, I ain't payin', I'm pimpin'
If ya waitin' for trickin' then you should date a magician
Wake up and listen, and keep this in the back of your mind
My thoughts are heavy, the weight alone could fracture your spine
Cats swear to God they high, hearin' Apathy's rhymes
And hold a torch up to trees like the back of a dime
These little backpack faggots probably jacked my lines
But like divorce with no prenup, half of it's mine
Y'all are just bitches (Esoterodactyl got morgues to fill)
While Ap's on a mission to make green like clorophyll

(Verse 2: Esoteric)
My team drops bread like chicks on health kicks
Ya squad could rock Bird throwbacks and couldn't ""sell ticks""
I melt shit with the words I spit
Steven King, disturbed and sick
You know Shay's killin' rappers that be speakin' on their dealin' coke days
Only birds you ever flipped was due to road rage
Only gray you ever pushed was due to old age
Bomb grower? Nah dude, the only weed you ever moved was with lawn mowers
You ain't traffickin' shit
No package in the back of the whip
No gats, no clips, why you rockin' that watch still?
Only archeologists check for iced-out Fossils
Is this a vintage affair? Them Jordans isn't that rare
Plus they so dingy they resemble my original pair
Servin' AotP? That'd be a head trip
Like a Cali-bred Crip rockin' Cincinnati Reds shit

Y'all tryin' to put a crease in the cards
Everybody want a piece of the gods

(Verse 3: Planetary)
I spit spontaneously, insane on a beat
Gigantic with the rap, I throw a flame in the street
Nothin' less than a professor manifestin' the heat
So hot, I don't even bring a piece when I beef
Rappers shot, make your casket drop
Pass the block, and get your ass beat down, we laugh and watch
And it's funny how we throw a rubber band on a knot
Smack you in the face with it and let you have it to shop
And the reason that you bleedin', you disrespected a demon
Cryin' like little bitches or newborns that's teething
We urban gorillas workin' with killers
Bow and arrows from the Pharaohs, dog you heard what the deal is
We the realest and you feel us 'cause you probably been through it
Suicidal rap, nigga, cut your skin to it
And shit don't matter if you die or live through it
We beat you till you piss bluish, hit you with sick fluid

(Verse 4: Des Devious)
I never aim to please, get cut quick, gone with the breeze
And post up, sparkin' my trees
Like it never happened, the captain of fly rappin'
Attackin' with war tactics and write it down in fine graphics
Cause havoc, my ""mobb's deep,"" gun butt, you now sleep
Your funeral be in a week, I dare you to creep
Pack ridiculous heat from sweepin' the streets
The tech nine to your meat, chopper bringin' defeat
To any one who oppose these assholes' murderous flows
I'm standin' here close from breakin' your nose
The life that you chose is nothin', why keep runnin'?
Shoot, I'm gunnin', my muthafuckin' cold deeds is headhuntin'
Frontin' is a waste of time, you get money and shine
On your grind, it's all in your mind
'Cause I've never seen you holdin' a spot, callin' a shot

Seven stories they'll have to climb
To find out what we've done
And to let them call, we'll be gone

Bluegrass and a wallflower sun 
And anyone visiting knows
Just where to go

The fine line that comes between the facts and history
