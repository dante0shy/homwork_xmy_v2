0,"[Rev. Tom] I'm here with the Funeral Director
[Fun. Dir] Mmmm-hmm
[Rev. Tom] He wants to tell people about, a lot of his records
[Fun. Dir] Mmmm-hmm!
[Rev. Tom] And the way he conducts his, churches and stuff like that

(The Funeral Director)
I bury bodies
I stick catheters, in their chest cavities
I keep things moving
I don't mind burying, I don't mind undertaking
Yes I will be your Funeral, Director
The Funeral Director
The Funeral Director

(Thee Undatakerz)
See I walk the urban streets
Bloodthirsty with spit drippin from my teeth
Black werewolf on the loose chewin ligaments
Only human without no beef
My next victim just might be you
The Undatakerz, East West coast bodybaggers
Draggin bodies up and down the block around the clock
Before the doc, toe tag 'em
Funeral Director slash bodies, leave 'em cut up in a blender
Whether it's John or Brenda, Sal or Glenda
Anybody corpse we dismember
See God made me this way, gave me this distemper
I was born with the intent to kill
Feelin' no emotion when the body drops
Actually the, sight of death, just might make me thrill
I love to watch flesh peel
Take the picture of you when you take yo' last breath
Tryin' to gasp for more air without no energy left
Orderlies move for death
Let your life go, let your life go, breathe slow
Let your life go, breathe slow
Let your life go, breathe slow
Just let your life go and breathe slow

(The Funeral Director)
I will bury you
I have no problem, with putting you in the ground
Pulling up my truck, putting your casket... inside, my hearse
Driving it up, to the graveyard

(M-Balmer)
M-Balmer got a style that is versatile
Blowin' up the room, make the crowd go wild
So have a smoke, not a cap
Now who not not not not not now
Let's see how many MC's jock my flow
Two thousand and ten, I'll be a legend though
Still keepin' up the flow
Fluid runnin' through my soul, make me grow
'Cause I'm instructable and I'm invincible

(The Funeral Director)
We have, platinum coffins, to put you in
You can believe, you will not, be coming back
Ha, ha ha, hahahahaha
Ah-hahahahahahaha
Ah-ahahahahahahaha
Ah-ahahahahahahahahahahaha
Ah...

1,"Floating down through the clouds
Memories come rushing up to meet me now
But in the space between the heavens and the corner of some foreign field
I had a dream, I had a dream

Goodbye Max, goodbye Ma
After the service when you're walking slowly to the car
And the silver in her hair shines in the cold November air
You hear the tolling bell
And touch the silk in your lapel

And as the tear drops rise to meet the comfort of the band
You take her frail hand
And hold on to the dream

A place to stay <i>(""Oi! A real one ..."")</i>
Enough to eat
Somewhere old heroes shuffle safely down the street
Where you can speak out loud
About your doubts and fears
And what's more, no one ever disappears
You never hear their standard issue kicking in your door

You can relax on both sides of the tracks
And maniacs don't blow holes in bandsmen by remote control
And everyone has recourse to the law
And no one kills the children anymore
And no one kills the children anymore

Night after night
Going 'round and 'round my brain
His dream is driving me insane

In the corner of some foreign field
The gunner sleeps tonight
What's done is done
We cannot just write off his final scene
Take heed of the dream
Take heed

",2
2,"D'you breathe the name
Of your saviour in your hour of need
And taste the blame
If the flavor should remind you of greed,
Of implication, insinuation and ill will
Till you cannot lie still
In all this turmoil
Before red cape and foil
Come closing in for a kill

Come feed the rain
'Cause I'm thirsty for your love
Dancing underneath the skies of lust 
Yeah, feed the rain 
'Cause without your love my life
Ain't nothing but this carnival of rust

It's all a game, avoiding failure
When true colors will bleed
All in the name of misbehavior
And the things we don't need
I lust for after no disaster can touch
Touch us anymore
And more than ever
I hope to never fall
Where enough is not the same it was before

Come feed the rain
'Cause I'm thirsty for your love
Dancing underneath the skies of lust
Yeah, feed the rain
'Cause without your love my life
Ain't nothing but this carnival of rust

Yeah, feed the rain
'Cause I'm thirsty for your love
Dancing underneath the skies of lust
Yeah, feed the rain
'Cause without your love my life
Ain't nothing but this carnival of rust

Don't walk away, don't walk away, oh
When the world is burning
Don't walk away, don't walk away, oh
When the heart is yearning
Don't walk away, don't walk away, oh
When the world is burning
Don't walk away, don't walk away, oh
When the heart is yearning

4,"Lithium- Don't wanna lock me up inside
Lithium- Don't wanna forget how it feels without
Lithium- I wanna stay in love with my sorrow
Oh, but God, I wanna let it go

Come to bed, don't make me sleep alone
Couldn't hide the emptiness, you let it show
Never wanted it to be so cold
Just didn't drink enough to say you love me

I can't hold on to me
Wonder what's wrong with me

Lithium- Don't wanna lock me up inside
Lithium- Don't wanna forget how it feels without
Lithium- I wanna stay in love with my sorrow
Oh, I don't wanna let it lay me down this time
Drown my will to fly
Here in the darkness, I know myself
Can't break free until I let it go
Let me go

Darling, I forgive you after all
Anything is better than to be alone
And in the end I guess I had to fall
Always find my place among the ashes

I can't hold on to me
Wonder what's wrong with me

Lithium- Don't wanna lock me up inside
Lithium- Don't wanna forget how it feels without
Lithium- Stay in love with you
Oh, I'm gonna let it go

5,"Too much to find, so much, so little time.
So many images persist to shade my mind.
Will I ever come around or will I just hit the ground?
Will I still be standing when it all comes around?

(Why can't I) seem to sort it out?
(Why am I) always filled with doubt?

So many people everywhere, so self-absorbed without a care for their viral lives.
I'd like to bleed them all.
When all is drained, who shall hold?
When mindless bodies screw tortured souls,
Will somebody be there to catch me when I fall?

(Why can't I) seem to sort it out?
(Why am I) always filled with doubt?
(How could I) always be so blind?
(Why can't I) Why can't I figure it out?

I could always hope for change, could always hope to rearrange.
But why not just abandon hope and tear it all apart now?

Tonight. Tonight.
Falling back down, into the pain.
Inside. Inside.
No I won't stay here.
No I won't stay here, stay here with you.

You took me to heaven.
You brought me to fall.
I took your mortality
For what made me feel whole.

You stole my dreams, made me lose track.
Tonight. Tonight.
You broke my trust, won't get it back.
Forever. Forever.
No I won't break down.
No I won't ever break down for you.

You made me feel needed.
You could see my soul.
No I won't break down.
No I won't ever break down for you.

You made me feel needed.
You could see my soul.
I gave you my loyalty.
You chose to make me fall.

You took me to heaven.
You brought me to fall.
I took your mortality

Que llevo mi coraz&#243;n a tender
Que dicen que el hielo bajo el sol se funde
Y mi coraz&#243;n es de hielo

Anhelo de tu recuerdo, te echo tanto de menos
Que desde que te marchaste, mi vida es solo un camelo
Me encuentro con la locura, y al dar con ella me pierdo
Camino pasito a paso, esto no tiene remedio
Me siento como un puchinela, usado y gastado a tu antojo
En un rinc&#243;n olvidado, y mi coraz&#243;n no es de trapo

Y no me preguntes donde voy
Que quiero alejarme
No me preguntes d&#243;nde voy

No me preguntes ni&#241;a donde voy
Que voy a recoger mi coraz&#243;n
Que al darle el calorcito de los rayos del sol
Se ha fundido todo el hielo

Te record&#233; todo el tiempo, y mis deseos no se fueron
Hice como si no existieras, y la verdad es que ment&#237;a
Fingiendo ser el mas fuerte, tan solo estaba escondido
Detr&#225;s de alguna cortina, pero sin perderte de vista
Prefiero ser el puchinela, y estar siempre atado a tus manos
Dejando que tu me muevas, llev&#225;ndome a donde quieras

Y no me preguntes d&#243;nde voy
Que quiero acercarme mi rubia
No me preguntes d&#243;nde voy
Que quiero volver a abrazarte
No me preguntes d&#243;nde voy
Que ardo en deseos de verte
No me preguntes d&#243;nde voy

9,"Creep with me while I crawl through the hood
Maniac lyricists just call me murs that's good
You'll get crushed when I bust on beats
And you'll never hear me holla bullshit for the streets
I'm not anti-white, or anti-nigga, just anti-ignorant and anti idiot
LP make the beat and ain't I killin' it
Don't care who you are, if I ain't feelin' it
I'm tellin' your ass
Fuck you and these labels that's be sellin that trash
And these underground artists with their sales gone bad
Fuck with me ill do it sugar free
And send you to the corner just to get my cash
Ill woop that ass
Put that on ur momma
And get ready for the action 'cause I don't bring drama
Ima tell the world you're wack
In every interview
Plus your squads kinda pale
You need some color in your crew
Plus your first rap tape way back in '92
You had slaughter, warren, slayer and firehouse
Thought this rap thing is cool hey I might try it out
There's only do and do not
There is no try
Hes in the ???? for true jedi
You was scared to come to shows 'cause they let the lead fly
Now you have no heart no soul no funk
And its 187 on you underground punks

Verse: Do you Like it? I can give a fuck how you feelin'. feel this. feel this. feel this. do you like it? feel this, bitch feel this, bitch feel this


I was bumpin nocturnal and my mind started to travel
On how I used to seek out MC's for raps to unravel
Now yous think I can't battle rap
'Cause I roll on cadillac
Put your money where your pie-hole is and watch me fuck you
Watch your cash like my name was jason biggs
I'm makin' kids wanna grow up to be astronauts again
'Cause they see bein an MC is not an option-win
Just a hungry motherfucker like me lookin' for fresh meat
To make 'em look foolish as hell over they're best beat
I press heat to your ear like gause to a wound
Hopin that it goes platinum like those cosby cartoons
If I don't get a plaque on my wall for platinum release
Ill still be a classic to y'all with plaque on my teeth
Chain smokin' brain chokin the shit outta rappers
I had to end your beginnin to start the next chapter
Now I'm on some other shit like that ?? that common wears
Or the enron affair or andres hair
Somebody else might but I just don't care
Wut you say or where your from
I'm the baddest motherfucker touch you down on kickdrums
Such as sick tongue I could be a ??
Just to wear this long beard to hide the IV
My goal since I was young be a fly MC
So I jumped off the gym junior high PE
Fell flat on my face everyone laughed at me
Now my flows so strong gravity defies me
And I float on air without a pair of nikes
So you just can't compare to pros real like these

11,"<b>[Ikon the Verbal Hologram/Vinnie Paz]</b>
The lawnmower man smashes, through ya skull with battle axes
We whip asses, with the jaunty daggers
And smash this, crushing opposition like we was fascist
Stigmata and four gashes
We bashes, the faggots who can't attack it right
Take they sternum and then turn 'em into my acolytes
That's the sight of blood, that make a child stop
That's the rights of thugs that keep it wild hot
I hate you, say a prayer to a heavenly father
It's fatal, like a natal military armada
We hotter, warriors from Atlantis
Couldn't overstand how raw the Hologram is
The mantis, who used the flame rod
You couldn't physically bruise the name God

<b>[Hook x2- Ikon]</b>
We smash mics, and blast too precise
And laugh as we cast the first stones at Christ

<b>[Jus Allah]</b>
We born builders, as life takes it's toll
Legends of the seven, embrace my soul
Transported off the planet, by a supreme force
And told to return on the day of Pentecost
I bisect the ways between Heaven and Earth
And scramble messages from God into your church
Deception, blinds your perception
My reflection outshines the other colors in the spectrum
The brethren, I cease the peace corps
We follow street laws, engaged in Beast Wars
The visionary bombs, with military arms
Aimed at that motherfucker with pitchfork and horns
I sent alchemy throughout the galaxy
To cause fire and ice, like Flames in Calgary
You're trapped in, the core of corruption
Left a fossil, in my path of destruction

<b>*Voice sample*</b>

<b>[Hook x2- Ikon]</b>
We smash mics, and blast too precise
And laugh as we cast the first stones at Christ

<b>[Ikon]</b>
I am the man who lives above the force of good and evil
<b>[Jus Allah]</b>
The man that handed down the powers to give to my people
<b>[Ikon]</b>
Live under laws of bald eagle
<b>[Jus Allah]</b>
There's no tomorrow
<b>[Ikon]</b>
Get trapped with the trenchcoat killers in Colorado
<b>[Jus Allah]</b>
Blazin' spark, feeling certain my days are marked
Live a life that conflicts with the ways I'm taught
<b>[Ikon]</b>
Fuck it, we bring it hardcore, raw and ragged
Ya team must be hidin they balls, like a faggot
<b>[Jus Allah]</b>
I came with the light and gave sight to the sages
Black ink contained to write truth on white pages
<b>[Ikon]</b>
You're sliced faceless
<b>[Jus Allah]</b>
Subjected to a massacre
<b>[Ikon]</b>
Jedi Mind, bombin your MOVE like John Africa
<b>[Jus Allah]</b>
We laugh at ya
<b>[Ikon]</b>
The devil is the bomber
<b>[Jus Allah]</b>
We unaffected as we protected by God's armor

<b>[Hook x2- Ikon]</b>
We smash mics, and blast too precise
And laugh as we cast the first stones at Christ

12,"When your faith in life is gone,
Come and speak to me.
When you're down and all messed up,
Seek my sympathy.

When everybody says no, no, no,
Well, it's your misfortune and none of my own,
Wrong, wrong, wrong,
Well, it's your misfortune that sweetens my song.

I can be the friend you want,
I can be your confidante,
I can be the right reminder at the right time,
Throwin' out the lifeline.

Stand in the light. Stand in the light. Stand in the light.
Stand in the light. Stand in the light. Stand in the light.

When your face is caked with mud,
Come and speak to me.
When the chill creeps in your blood,
Seek my sympathy.

When everybody says no, no, no,
Well, it's your misfortune and none of my own,
Wrong, wrong, wrong,
Well, it's your misfortune that sweetens my song.

I can be the air you drink,
Every single thought you think,
I can be the right notion in the meantime,
Warm you like the sunshine.

Stand in the light. Stand in the light. Stand in the light.
Stand in the light. Stand in the light. Stand in the light.

Stand in the light. Stand in the light. Stand in the light.
Stand in the light. Stand in the light. Stand in the light.

Plus a cooked slab, chopped up, dimes is swoll
If I spot the laws comin', hey its time to roll
Candy Carter got a line of parole, Outta control
The first fell a Tuesday this month oh sweet thang

Me come to tear your block up
If you don't want no problems
You better get off the corner

I make a livin' in this crooked public distributin

The hottest D in town lookin' for me hit me Tuesday, like after six
See I crack the bricks right down to Z's
Got pounds of trees, my blocks blazin' qp's to ki's
Gangin' in the cheese, them bricks is comin'
No droughts I don't sit on nothin'
I don't believe I'm frontin
If I give you a dime, I leave with somethin'
The big dog, Nigga I got the city under siege
And the law don't bother me, I give the pigs a couple of G's
Shit, I hustle strong to push this work through the streets
I'm tryin' to deal with every nigga, and sell the birds up cheap
I'm greedy, if there's any money bein made from drugs I need it
Twenty bricks two weeks completed, you can't beat it
Whatever you want, holla at me when you need to get it
Does anybody else, I'll pay 'em a visit
That's when ya heard...

Come here peeps
I'm hearin that you run these streets
You don't want beef
Then get off the corner

The date - summer, August 25th
You was transferred from Riker's Island to Attica State Prison
Gina, Thompson

I told you you shouldn'ta went out there with those other girls
And stole a coach bag out of Macy's
Arguin with me every night, you was crazy
Callin your grandmother sayin' I beat you, you think I'm mental and crazy
That Benz you pulled up you stole you didn't faze me
You had a nice body with bikers
Inmates and female C.O.'s was lookin' at your body at Riker's
I took time to write you a letter
But you wanted me to put dope in your sweater
I thought you was sick, with the flu, did you get any better?
Did you write back your Auntie Trineta? Floss and don't pay
Jack say he seen you with a drug dealer that day
You woulda been better off takin' the subway

My girl's in jail for life, never comin' home - never comin' home
She got to pay the price

(Kool Keith)
You got too big in New York
You needed big hustlers around everywhere you walk
A lot of Cristal, fake ballers poppin' corks
Now you in a two-inch cell, eatin eggs and pork
Friday the 13th, your birthday, the worst day
I still had love for your dumb ass anyway
Bentleys and Rolls Royces
The answering machine filled up with mysterious voices
Your moms Ms. Jones called, I was in the mall, she said,
""Keith - Tina and Terry got them fake credit cards.
They got my daughter out there - I ain't seen Gina in two weeks.""
I hung up the phone
I knew you was workin with some bronze pimp in the streets
(Pimp in the streets... pimp in the streets)

My girl's in jail for life, never comin' home - never comin' home
She got to pay the price

(Kool Keith)
I called the operator to block the calls and stop the calls
The ceiling in my apartment was leakin like Niagara Falls
Sendin you a bunch of money, clothes and munchin money
You got a lot of phone call threats from a girl named Sunny
I seen the chick from the back
Puerto Rican girl with a nice ass drivin' a black Cadillac
With a guy with long sideburns, is that your mack?
(Is that your mack... is that your mack)

My girl's in jail for life - you're a bad girl - never comin' home
She got to pay the price - you're a bad girl...
My girl's in jail for life - you're a bad bad girl - never comin' home

In the pouring rain,
And now I'm singing love songs
To keep away the pain,
Because I know your leaving
But I don't know why,
But I know I'll never get you back
So I guess I guess that I won't try,
Won't TRYYY
The secrets you've been keeping
Inside your head (inside your head)
The times that you had hurt me
With things you said (things you said)
And now I know your leaving
But I don't know why
But I'm awfully glad it's raining
This way you can't see me cry.
So now I'll try my best to,
To forget the past
Another hopeless romance
That I thought would last
Because you used me up
And pushed me to the side,
Now I know I'll never get you back,
So I guess I guess that I won't try,
Won't TRYYY
The secrets you've been keeping
Inside your head (inside your head)
The times that you had hurt me
With things you said (things you said)
And now I know your leaving
But I don't know why but
I'm awfully glad it's raining

Don't know when I'll hit the ground
Hold me when I fall
Headlights in my face
My body's full of scars
Words are lost and won't be found
Stay until I'm gone
Stumbling on my knees

I'm dancing in the dark
Shrinking cities feel the sound
Hear the silent hum
Searchlights in the skies
I'm blinded by the stars
There is darkness all around
Hold me when I cry
Those were all my days

I'm falling out of cars
Hanging on the windscreen
I'm blinded by the headlights
I'm killing ground
I'm dancing in the dark
Stumbling on the highway
I'm guided by the city light
I'm lost and found

I'm falling out of cars
Don't know when I'll hit the ground
Hold me when I fall
Headlights in my face
I'm dancing in the dark
Shrinking cities feel the sound
Hear the distant hum
Searchlights in my eyes

I never took the time
I should have told you then
I never found the time
Falling out of cars

I'm falling out of cars
Hanging on the windscreen
I'm blinded by the headlights
I'm killing ground
I'm dancing in the dark
Stumbling on the highway
I'm guided by the city light
I'm lost and found

21,"C'&#232; bisogno di aguzzare la vista
Per capire quali sono gli amici
Bisognerebbe restare svegli
Per scoprire tutti i nemici
Ci vorrebbe un paio di scarpe nuove
Per partire, per scappare lontano
E poi seguire una traccia sbagliata
Perdersi meglio e non tornare pi&#249; indietro
Non c'&#232; bisogno di una foto ingiallita
Per vedere quanto siamo cambiati
Non c'&#232; bisogno...no!
Bisognerebbe fermarsi in tempo
Non aver fretta ma rallentare
Bisognerebbe solo ascoltare
o ancora meglio, cambiare canale
C'&#232; bisogno di stare attenti
Nell'osservare la nostra storia
Guardarsi indietro e poi capire
Che c'&#232; bisogno di pi&#249; memoria
Si, c'&#232; bisogno!
Ci vorrebbe una muta di corde nuove
Per suonare sempre scordati
C'&#232; bisogno di nuove canzoni
Con parole per sognare pi&#249; forte
Bisognerebbe fare sogni grandiosi
Oltre la noia e le nevrosi
Avere cura, avere pazienza
Di tutta quanta l'intelligenza...

22,"It's the beginning of the 9th inning and I'm winning
You'll find me mind-bending inside of each five-minute time limit
And it's documented, we're breaking bones of contention
Fine tuning what's spinning and expanding my dominion
These upper-handed dimensions all contributed to the folklore
Got rappers raising their standards, fans demanding what they'd hoped for
Cramming letters in a bottle. We'll just call it a test tube
My style is Aristotle mixed with Krush Groove (So Just Move!)
And watch my verses cut through when you hear the words I Love You
Break off a piece of my heard tucked into every record groove
And you'll walk different in these corrective shoes
But you'll recognize the revolution and act out what most don't get to do
You'll take what's meant for you, no longer survive on what they pass down
Win or lose, you'll live your life knowing you never backed down
'Cause man shall not live by the bottle alone
I keep a fist raised to the sky so you can follow me home, it goes?

If you know like we know, BREATHE SLOW
BREATHE SLOW?(Repeat)

Until my body cracks the pavement and shakes the face of the basement
Lacing the foundation with scars that sacrifice is bound to leave
Break inner-city boundaries so suburbanites are down to see
This cultural way of life and how music is more than sound to me
But freedom's lungs are heavy from pushing these smoke signals out
And we've become so disillusioned that we're scared to notice
The eviction notice speaking its clout with screams and shouts, but trust me
Clarity's waiting there on the other side of your focus
So snatch the breath from blasphemy emphatically
Transform naturally, control the art before it masters me
Breathe slow and hold the hand of whoever you can reach for
Touch the ones you've never seen before till the common good is restored
Till the homeless are all execs and capitalism yields to ethics
Till janitors live in mansions and schoolteachers can push a Lexus
Till beef is deaded and debt is erased or collected
Till the projects and country clubs are now and forever connected
I'll speak my messages till they get it
Until you're touched by something sacred and love is all that you're left with
Blessed is the head that shares the crown that he possesses
Consider yourselves my brethren and this song is my confession
'Cause man shall not live by the bottle alone
I keep a fist raised to the sky so you can follow me home
And all your problems can't be solved by one call on the phone
I keep a fist raised to the sky so you can follow me home, it goes?

Right before you rock a show, BREATHE SLOW
When a promoter owes you dough, BREATHE SLOW
When your career doesn't blow (up), BREATHE SLOW
You bounced five checks in a row, BREATHE SLOW
If you're tired of being po, BREATHE SLOW
You can't see the status quo, BREATHE SLOW
You got more cons than pros, BREATHE SLOW
You got fisticuffs to throw, BREATHE SLOW
Ayo, your boss told you no, BREATHE SLOW
Say Mars ILL told you so, BREATHE SLOW
You gotta suffer to grow, BREATHE SLOW
Shine your light until you glow, BREATHE SLOW?

Sing me to sleep, echoes in the hills
You can't hear a word 
You can't hear my broken will

The world through a windshield is careless and cheap
I toss and I turn, I can't get to sleep
Counting the hours the days that turn into weeks

I've been wrong but it's alright
There've been long and lonely nights
I was lost till I found you
Turn out the light, I'll stay if you want me to

Somehow my time got out of my hands
I just wanna stop master commands
I'm telling you true it won't be this way again

Long ways away but you're never alone
Look at the sky over our home
I'll be around a few more miles to go

I've been wrong but it's alright
There've been long and lonely nights

Turn out the light, I'll stay if you want me to

27,"Every eleven minutes, across the USA
A man is a victim of Cock Blocking
This action usually results in broken friendships
The following, is an example...

(Kool) Aiyyo Jinx
(Jinx) Hey whassup G?
(Kool) This girl'll be here in a minute
(Jinx) Uh-huh
(Kool) The bitch got a nice ass, and I'm tryin' to get in it
(Jinx) Cool, that's all right, but why you tellin' me this shit?
(Kool) To make sure you don't mind
(Jinx) Uh-huh
(Kool) chillin' out while I hit it
(Jinx) Naww nigga, I'll just turn on the TV set
(Jinx) Get paid, hit the skins, get some pussy, get your dick wet
(Kool) All right bet, because my dick is hard as hell
*Ding dong ding dong*
(Kool) The bitch is ringin' on my bell

Opened the door, ""Whassup baby? Yo come on in
Here, take a seat, I'll introduce you to my friend""
Now everything is going according to plan
""Yo Jinx this is Debbie, Debbie this is Jinx my man"" (Whassup baby?)
I went to the closet, hung up her coat, put up her hat
""Yo Jinx,"" ""Whassup?""
""Later nigga, I'm goin' to the back"" ""See ya!""
I took her to the back, closed the doors and I paused...
... I'm gonna get some drawers
So we laid on the bed and I just smiled
Because I'm dreamin' about fuckin' her doggystyle
So I'm thinkin' bout some hits that I can slip her
*Zipper sound* Fuck it, I'll just pull down her zipper
Feelin' her ass, and damn the shit is soft
""Aiyyo baby, why don't you take your shirt and pants off?""
I got the whore ready to let a nigga score
*Knocking* Yo who the FUCK is at my door?
*Knocking* Now she's annoyed, and boy I got some luck
I cracked the door, ""Yo Jinx, what the FUCK is up?""

""Aiyyo G man, I just, y'know, I wanna get some water and shit
You know I'm kind of thirsty knahmsayin homey? Heh heh""

""What water nigga? Go 'head, go and get it"" ""Aight""
""Now leave me the fuck alone so I can hit it"" ""Aight thanks man""
So then I slammed the door shut *door slams*
I turned around this bitch is pullin her pants back on her butt
Nah chill, yo he ain't comin' back no more
I pulled her pants back down and threw 'em on the floor *whoosh*
I'm tryin' to convince her but the shit didn't work
So now I'm here playin' tug-of-war with her shirt *rips* (oops)
Yeah don't worry, that same shit won't happen twice
*Knocking* ""Aiyyo G man, where's the ice??""
Shit, didn't even get my jock in
*Knocking* Cause niggaz like Jinx is Cock Blocking

""Now you know this just don't make NO kind of sense""
""Blockin my cock, like a god damn ??""
""And for the life of me, I didn't know why..""
""Blockin my cock, like a god damn ??""

(Kool G. Rap)
Thinkin' of a bitch I could be hittin, for no salary
So I called Valerie, found out the bitch was babysittin
The baby's parents went to Europe; and I could see her now
Suckin my dick and lickin' my nut like it was maple syrup
She said, ""Come over I'm alone""
And I was knockin' at the door before the bitch hung up the phone
""Hey whassup baby? You know I miss you"" ""Whassup?""
Yeah that's some shit you gotta say to get your dick into the pussy tissue
Went in the house and had a seat
The little boy put fifty motherfuckin toys by my feet
Smashin up my ankles with Tonka jeeps
I wish this little motherfucker'd take his ass to sleep
Now my leg got crazy scratches
I said, ""Here, you wanna play?"" I gave his ass a book of matches (Hey!)
I couldn't even get a rap
Without this little motherfucker jumpin' his ass into my bitch's lap
I started rubbin on her curves
But I'm mad because this little brat is gettin' on my nerves
I pulled the bitch up by her hair ""What's the matter baby?""
""Aiyyo, whydon'tcha get rid of little man?"" ""All right baby""
She took me to a room that was dark ""Hey, come in here""
I was undressin on the way to get a head start
And then I let the door shut
Lifted up her skirt and started feelin' on the whore's butt
Suckin on her titties like candy
Five minutes later had her comin' in her panties
Now she's ready for the dick
""Yo you ready bitch?"" (mmm-hmm) ""Well first, take a lick!""
Down on her knees is where she dropped
Suckin on and suckin on and suckin on my cock
Bust that nut, that's what I'm hopin
Then yo, all of a sudden, the door flew wide open
What the hell is this about? *child crying*
She jumped up in a flash and took my dick out of her mouth
Yeah, the little nigga's throwin' a fit
Talkin' about he's hungry and shit
""Wait a minute baby, let me get up so I can feed him""
But I felt like takin' off my belt and beat him
He already gave my leg a cut
Now the little bastard is fuckin' up my nut
She, didn't even get the lead off
So I picked up one of his Ninja Turtle dolls and pulled the head off
(Hey whatchu doin'?) Yeah motherfucker now we even
Forty-five minute passed, the bitch ain't back, fuckit I'm leavin'
I got dressed, and put my hat back on my head (Hey!)
""Later bitch,"" ""No wait baby""
""Drop dead!"" ""What??""
""And by the way, thanks a lot and uh...
Fuck you and that little nigga for Cock Blockin!""

""Now you know this just don't make NO kind of sense""
""Blockin my cock, like a god damn ??""
""And for the life of me, I didn't know why..""
""Blockin my cock, like a god damn ??""

(Kool G. Rap)
So all you niggaz with the helmets and shoulderpads
Stay the FUCK away from me, word up
The next time you wanna block nigga
Try out for the Jets baby, word up
Yo, that nigga Polo's Cock Blockin like a motherfucker
That nigga Jinx is Cock Blockin
My dancers are straight up roadblocks 'n' shit
That nigga Bill Blass has been Cock Blockin all his life

Fiendin to make his dreams come true, but see, money was caught mean
Started runnin' wild and livin' life type of foul, that was my shorty's style
But deep down in heart he was still only a child
He was typin nice at ball, if he had height, y'all
Mighta been 'NBA Today', instead I watched his life fall
Blowin' up the spots and poppin' them tec glocks
Collectin street props, splittin tops, didn't stop, so many men dropped
Started committin murder after murder
Blasted the last nigga that tried to riff so fast he flipped him like a burger
Slipped and became the victim of his own murder hunger
He got put six feet under by a small shorty that was younger
And this type of street violence today happens too often
It hit me hard as hell to see my dog up in the coffin
People droppin' a rose when the casket is closed
Hey yo, that's the name of the game out on the street, that's how it goes
They say: ""Live by the trigger, die by the trigger""
It ain't about whose gun is more bigger, nigga
It's bout whose draw is quicker

Keep it real on the street, money, and look out for one another

Thinkin' back when I was chillin' with K-Von, but now he's long gone
So I carried on and wrote this song to keep the strong on
Me and black-o way back in childhood when we was wild hoods
Runnin' around the neighborhood and up to no good
Started hangin' hard out there on the boulevard in stolen cars
Then put behind bars sellin drugs and pullin yards
Then my crimey got locked up for cookin the rock up
Started bouncin' uptown to stuck up, my nigga straight blew the block up
Yeah, the blue and whites was on sight runnin' with flashlights
On the double a fast life, that's when he seen his last nights
Out on the street runnin' from the heat
Then got locked up from (Happy New Year!)
All the way down to (New Year's Eve!)
The two of those in a wardrobe of clothes
Got back on crackin', I let him whip the macks and go lookin' for hoes
And then another sad story is headed for me
When I found out another soldier died in the territory
So in memory of my dog I write a lyric
Straight hopin melodies travel from my mind to your spirit
Hear it when I get biz for K-Von, I'm pledgin
Died on 104 Northern Boulevard, Corona, Queens legend

33,"(Verse 1: Pigeon John)
I live on the road, a modern day hobo
Trained to eat quick and expect the low blow
Get what you can from a dried up hole
In the land of the lost, cowboys in the sand
And my soul is the coal, and my life is the flame
And it's burning to earn all the lights and the fame
And it's turning to ash every step towards cash
And I'm losing it fast so I mash on the gas
But it's too late
My fate is a broken-hearted freshman even before my first date
And I smile at my call, another yes, yes y'all
With every summer, there's fall
So I just rock in my chair while they rock to the beat
A whole trainload of fresh meat
And it's so sweet how they dream, their young hearts beam
But they really don't know what it means, but they will though...

(There by subway train) Another day booked, I'm a fish on a hook now
(There by subway train) It's too late to turn out my ride till I die now
(There by subway train) Hitching a ride into town with my hands out
(There by subway train) I gotta go now, gotta go now, gotta go now...

(Verse 2: Manchild)
Took my car to the MARTA station, train to the airport
Feet to the bare floor, fists to declare war
Fame as a flare, tore pain from your stare
Used the game as a springboard, my name's at you're in-store
Kick to the snare drum, get here to there, son
They stick to the chair like chicks that get their hair done
Spit this to spare none, rhyme liquid in rare form
Commit to prayer born, brought heat to stay warm
Rap is my two cents, backed by the movement
Sacrificed my words to give you Pigeon John and Blueprint
Pleased just to thank you, hang with a strange few
Five to the Deepspace, stay the same just to change you
Pen to the notepad, mind to the starshine
Knee to the groundwork, 'cause right now is our time
Plane to the down south, MARTA to the train stop
Walked to the car and drove back to the block...

(Verse 3: Blueprint)
Are we there yet? Let me know, I'm feeling restless
From traveling up what feels like stair steps
And I hope it doesn't make me weak when I start to question
How far I'm willing to go to deliver this message
But the point of no return is where we're all at
It's easier to push forward than to go back
And since I can't go back to life before rap
I'ma play this game and boost all my stats
I was born at a time when you earned respect
For the rhyme and the way you made words connect
Not the money that you made or the girls you sexed
A concept you obviously haven't heard of yet
I did more shows in a month than you did in your life
Ate gas station food, stayed up late nights
Met a couple women that I'd like to make my wife
And realized that I'd travel anywhere for mics...

You're trippin' me out, sho nuff
When you stroll up you make niggas fold up
Hold up, I been peepin your ways
Plus the pedal pushers and braids got my mind in a daze
You look sweeter than glaze, make me wanna misbehave
But you playin' hard to get, you gotta run a trick play
Flea flickers, steady buying shots of liquor
All dogs chase the cat so it's a must I sick her
Hand picker, pretty face and toes
Check complexion and pose, see the chosen be chose
Then I turn up your nose, you been chose by a bachelor
I just had to distract you for a minute and holler at ya
It's mandatory I snatch her
Cause the statues'll knock at ya
Spend some time with Po-yo 'cause I ain't hard to adapt to
If you have to, just give it some thought, see what I'm about
Ain't no fusion, no doubt, can't lie, you're trippin' me out

Not only 'bout the ass, that's how I got this S-class
I got my own cash, and I watch my own ice
Peeped the real in me huh? That's why you looked twice
Vision Snow in your life, holdin' you tight
Relievin your stress as I caress you through the night
I'm the go get it type, to make sure we both right
No fuss, no fight and we can blow like dynamite
With you handlin your buisiness and me handlin mine
With us both on the grind we can't help but to climb
As far as time, baby, we got forever
But for right now, let's concentrate on this cheddar
And reaching higher levels, sportin diamond bezzles
Can you imagine the shit we can have together?
Me trippin'? Never, I'm down for whatever

I could see us in a six flippin like a baton
You set off my alarm, when you walk you perform
Spotted you in the crowd and picked you like a pecan

Well let's hop this don and discuss how we increase our funds
I know it drives you crazy when I talk in digits baby
Ain't nothin' shady about this lady
Everything is everything and I put it down for you daily

You got me fallin', baby
On top of that I can hear your body callin, baby
In the Impala so you know I'm boss ballin baby
Steady crawlin and the motor ain't stallin baby
It's all gravy
On sight you hooked me, whehn you spoke you shook me
First impressions be a trip and you immediately took me
I'm far from a rookie, star status of course
You the glass on the blaze driving me like a torch
That's why I want you by my side so I can flaunt you
You don't want a square, you want a thug nigga, don't you?
Let's bend us a corner, scratch off in the night
And everything's gonna be all right
It's goin' down

37,"The day that civil glory dismembered my civility
I could have parted ribs and flesh like a different kind of Red Sea,
Drowned the ancient east in western progress,
Custom and the least of all our pride and sentiments.

Which turned out to be the closest thing to a fashion trend
That's ever been put on trial.
Which turned out to be the closest thing to a fashion trend
That's ever been put on trial.

The rest was cast off as denial of statehood and mastery;
The ultimate form of treason is the treacherous use of reason,
The treacherous use.

Employed by the bastard sons of American fore-fathers who keep this fire burning
With the flesh of their would-be American daughters, daughters, daughters, daughters!

What will happen to our children when the least of us pass on?
Us who fought the monsters of our country's crowded closet,
Us who dropped the bombs on goodness when we saw it wasn't flawless.
Us whose youthful life was hostage to what harm did,
Us who fought the hardest to be swept under the carpet.

And I'm still a cigarette softly smoking on the edge of a metal ashtray.
I begged this place to let me burn, and it whispered, ""burn away"".

Forever haunted, more than afraid
Asphyxiate on words I would say

There are no flowers, no, not this time
There will be no angels gracing the lines
Just these stark words I find

I'd show a smile but I'm too weak
I'd share with you, could I only speak
Just how much this hurts me

I cannot stay here, I cannot leave
Just like all I loved, I'm make believe
Imagined heart, I disappear, seems
No one will appear here and make me real

There will be no angels gracing the lines

Everything that catches up must come to pass
And your voice is the one inside my head

All your time frames
And your mind games
Gonna go where the four winds blow

The grass and trees don't recognize it
The earth cries I own who I am

And the stars above on night herd

The wires and fences were gone
It's like a family reunion

With your poison in my blood

Bittersweet are the memories
That make old lovers pine
But I'll trade all the memories
Just to have your heart in mine

Everybody's talking to me
But they just can't explain
Disappeared from all the pages
And nothing seems the same

Was a time I thought I knew you
When I looked you in the eye
Now the same eyes look right through me
You're too cool to see me cry

Must be lonely

It's too militant, it's too militant
Aiyo, aiyo, aiyo, aiyo

(Killah Priest)
Aiyo, we night breathe, move through the night at light speed
With Timb's on, baggy denims and white tees
We rest inside our tents, with Mr. Lightly
The right trees turn my eyes to Chinese
Then speak like Israelite, become Christ
A crown of thorns placed on my head and gun fights
Escape through the night, for holdin' my sons tight
Chased by shadows, runnin' towards the lights
Relatin' to pharaohs, I speak from peace pipes
Each night, then you burn all friends of 'dro
Givin' praises due, abundance of dough
Held by the ebony prince, heavenly set
Down to the streets where we plan our revolt
Amongst strangers, and clouds of weed smoke
Addicts and heartless that love to deep throat
I sit amongst goons, gangsta, ex-felons
Ex-cons, addicts discussin' our rebellion
On the phone with reverends, holdin' up my weapons
Waitin' for the beast to set off Armageddon

(Chorus 2X: Killah Priest and Kurupt)
It's too militant, throw your gats up
Nigga, wanna act up, nigga get clapped up, what
It's too militant, throw your fists high
Let that catch a whip ride, nigga, we split five, why

(Killah Priest)
It's too militant...
I shoot through trench coats, don't trust kin folks
Keep my friends close, so I can watch 'em
Through hard laughter, never know what he's plottin'
Hunger, then he slipped his hands in your pockets
Clip your wallets, it's nothin' personal, it's just projects
Watchin' a videotape of Christopher Wallace
Footage exposed, bullet holes in the side of his jeep
We hold it in, till we collide with police
Ride for 2Pac, and all the soldiers every been shot
Though they body rot, they spirit rest inside of my pen
Each of 'em tune in, I write the Blueprints that's Stillmatic
Build with Arabs, my mic can heal the masses
Or feel the caskets, I studied the books of Iron Octopus
Ladies ride the hook, niggaz spit the verses
A pit of serpents, stand and curved in a s shape
Then I make your death date
I'm hell spawned, drawn near the Hell's gate
The Indian lady warned me an old man, with pale face
She said ""Fork tongue make painful kisses
And Priest, when you talk, all the angels listen""

(Outro: Killah Priest)
It's too militant...

63,"(Mad Child)
Sometimes I stare at the wall when I'm alone in my room
I'm an abusive reclusive like Dr. Doom
Parts of darkness descend and consume me
You wont believe the gloomy thoughts that run through me
I'm proof ? if you spend the night
Leave the next day like ""I don't think his heads on right""
Try to talk to myself but I don't listen
I've got split personalities and competition
And which ones Amanda? I've got issues
I could be standing in front of your face and I'm not with you
Schitzophrenia, Shane's brains distorted
Sort of compulsive, obsessive, disorder
Mathematical pattern addict of depraved mind
Before I go to bed I hit the light switch seven times
Yes, um, never mind, put the knife back
Mad Child I'm outta my mind, but I'll be right back

It's all in your head, you need to unwind
Your losing your grip, the paranoia never ends
It's all in your head, what you see in your mind
There's no reason to trip, the paranoia never ends
When your mind is acting wild
And you swear your insane
Can't nothing help you out
Of this trap you're in
You don't know which way to turn
And your head is in pain
Can't nothing help you out
Of this insanity

(Prevail)
There's no one behind you, there's no one beside you
There's no one beside you, you know as well as I do
There's no voice inside you, that shadow isn't moving
You must be losing to confusion having illusions
Still you wanna prove it, paranoia
That someone might be coming for you, no one's trying to kill you stupid
There's no Norman Bates, peeking in your window
There's no Patrick Bateman trying to pick you up in limos
You pop another pill, to try and calm your nerves
But prescriptions make the descriptions a lot worse
Your seeing red bursts, and then your head hurts
You should have checked under the bed first
Crawling on all fours, locking all the doors
You must have flown over the cuckoos nest and lost your course
I thought I told ya, don't let that shit control ya
'Cause paranoia will destroy ya just a lesson for ya

(Moka Only)
Yo it's paranoia in your brain cell
You think the worlds looking at you but you can't tell
You need to find yourself a hobby or something and stop frontin'
Nobodys out to get you, nobody wants nothin'
I think you got a chemical imbalance
When there's silence, you swear you hear talkin' and sirens
Maybe it's a different environment that you need
But whatever it is, your minds dying to be free
Your trying to perceive with the usual procedures
Your chests feeling tight, you think your having seizures
Maybe your just trying to hard to fit in
You need to let that shit go and get counselling my friend

And told me life is what you make it

To act like you want it, touch this boy's a ton wearer
Me the semi popper, SL shot ya
Tell mo' deep call the copper
'Cause you wanna flip mo', Bucktown sicko
Ask my nigga Kicko 'bout Miami strip shows
Real deal, PNC Steele
True warrior, I'm not Holyfield
In the words of Marvin Gaye, ""What's Going On?""
Black mask, black glove, B-I-G love

(Verse 2-Buckshot)
Yeah, that's how I like it
High with a hangover, me and my mic get
Might just take a little day off to lay off
Niggas like you that don't pay off, you fake boss
This ain't a rap, this reality
You sad to see I set up a salary, you mad at me?
Well, Duck Down is the home
Where we put it down for two-thousand and on
And anybody gettin' gully is us
So anybody gettin' money is us, the rest is up
Not really worth the mentionin'
When the last time you heard a rapper with a pension?
And mention him, B-U-C-K
Look on my grill, duke, do you see play?
Nah, I come fully equipped
One rubber, one key to burn rubber, one rubber grip

[Chorus: Tek] + (Buckshot)
Is Boot Camp the best to do it? (Yeah)
Tell me, do you love our music? (Say Yeah)
Can I talk to you for a minute? (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
Allow my man's to get off in it (You say Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Allow my man's to get off in it (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Is Boot Camp the best to do it?
Tell me, do you love our music?

(Verse 3-Steele)
Niggas ain't ready for the shit we got
The Clik we got, the heat we bust, the beats we rock
The street not Pop, but don't think a T won't pop
A team that I've got got a mean pump shot
Sleep not, me no speak to cops
But not nothin', not one dime drop
Stop snitchin', clock digits, clock chicken
Block sizzlin', cops sniffin', pop biscuits, leave not one witness

(Verse 4-Rock)
Niggas be shakin' like pits when they lock on, I rock on
Calm, in these streets or in jail, gettin' my high rocks on
Even though I rock with the red, gettin' my pop on
I'm a D-E-C-E-P-T-Icon
You mutha fuckin' right, Pa, I fight hard and I like crons
It ain't my fault I don't like y'all [Word], stop actin' like broads
Fold yo' bitch ass up, you a tripod
We don't need no cameras for this version of ""Die Hard""
Oh my God! Oh my goodness, no, say ""Oh my Rockness""
I'm a God to y'all, Rock, damn it, all of y'all my kids
All of y'all doin' shit I done did years ago
So all y'all suck my dick in stereo

(Verse 5-Louieville Sluggah)
You'se a bullshitter, I'm a big-dream go-getter
Then I go get her, let the whole crew hit her
Then I send her back room to ya
Where you kissin' her and eatin' her, and niggas finish beatin' her
You'se a Jackass, your new name is Steve-O
Ray, Ray, Ray, niggas don't believe you
I take care of niggas I fuck wit
But you on the other hand, Uncle Tom ass nigga
Callin' me a brother man, damn
You would've had me if I ain't know no better, man
Believe half of what you see and none of what you hear
In one ear and right out the other
You can't fool me, a G schooled me
Man listen, my life is somethin' like a movie
And you just a mouse tryin' to get a crumb, get him some
But you ain't gettin' shit, or put back on the strip

(Outro-Buckshot)
Headz Ain't Redee for the shit we got
Headz Ain't Redee, man, I swear they not
Headz Ain't Redee for the shit we got
Headz Ain't Redee, man, I swear they not
Headz Ain't Redee for the shit we got
Headz Ain't Redee, man, I swear they not
Headz Ain't Redee for the shit we got

It's he all he knows from them
It's all he wants, and some day someone said,
""James if you run for me, I can make your dreams come true.""
He said,""it's not quite what I want, but sign me up.""

Well think before you write.
You will see when you left but you hate your life.
And you don't want to be that some day.
You'll thank me tomorrow.

But james said,""no, I will go, and run many many miles.""
And he had always be someone he didn't want to be,
But james that's tough
He says,"" oh no what have I become.""
He says,"" oh no what have I become.""

But look at what you'll find.
You can't see that he loves, but he hates his life.
'Cause he hides it so well when he smiles,
And he knows that you'll never find out.

What have I become,
What have I become,
What have I become,
He says,""what have I become"",
What have I become,

Wearin Pele jackets
Fast loot tactics, I'm well up in the millionaire bracket
The boss of all bosses, I own racehorses and a fortress
Corridors with olympic torches and Mona Lisa portraits
Jacuzzis and saunas and eatin steak at Benny Harner's
Bentley's limousine the front yard stream is full of pirahnas
I'm set, a private jet, I drink a lot of Beck's
Get a lot of sess condo and duplex, diamond infested Rolex
Deliver a crown at the world units with silver china
Sippin on finer wine-r you see more shines than diamond miners
The Highness, kingpin of heroin
I'm thorough when I have to bring the terror in
Handle business in each and every borough in
Town or city, I'm rollin' like Frank Nitty, I'm rich and pretty
Back up kiddies, I got crimies that's grimy and gritty
A nigga that's spunky and likes to keep his pockets chunky
Makin' most of my money, from all the dopefiends and junkies
I learned from the best the ones that's livin'
And the ones that's put to rest
So I bless my chest with a vest and pack a Smith-N-Wes
And then I'm off to get the snaps, not the scraps
The game is be a real mack, the name is Kool G Rap

Now it's a damn shame, what I gotta do just to make a dollar
Living in this game, sometimes it makes you wanna holler
It's a damn shame, what I gotta do just to make a dollar
Living in this game, sometimes it makes you wanna holler

I got a fly hoe up under the wing, a swinger that does her thing
And if you step inside my ring, she'll bang it out and make your brains hang
She sits at restaurant tables with mink foxes and sables
Drinkin' Cherenade brand label she'll rock a sucker's cradle
And yeah, honey is more bounce to the ounce
She walks around with lucci in large amounts
Millions inside Swiss bank accounts
Her name is Tammy, got a beach house in Miami
Rides around with a small jammy in her silk and satin panties
A down hoe, a Foxy Brown hoe, standin her ground hoe
And if you clown yo she'll turn into a bust a round hoe
Fly as a Heaven's Angel got sapphires in her bangles
Diamond earrings hangin' dingle gettin' money from all angles
She's pretty under the New York city bright lights
And real light, way after midnight, I hit it cause the slit's tight
Wake up early and make my rounds, break up break down
Packin a silver four pound, some clowns be trying to get down
Light up a smoke and grab a stack of C-notes
Them slick stick up kids don't get no free dough bro
'Cause I ain't tryin' to be broke
I goes all out for G Rap and this honey nothin' funny
It's a damn shame, what I gotta do to get the money

Now it's a damn shame, what I gotta do just to make a dollar
Living in this game, sometimes it makes me wanna holler
It's a damn shame, what I gotta do just to make a dollar
Living in this game, sometimes it makes me wanna holler

Of your past are painful reminders

Take these wings
And make good on all the promises
Unkept in this life
The judgments weighed against you
Fell away to embrace
Your memory again

And make good on all the things 
That were controlling you
And then destroyed you
Your short breath of life

Take these wings
And make good on all the promises
Unkept in this life
The judgments weighed against you
Fell away

Fulfill all of the unsaid promises you made
To family and friends
Through blessings and understandings

And I can't seem to understand why
The end of your pain meant the end of a rope
But I guess it's the only freedom that you've ever known

The price you've paid is dying alone
Please bless this child
All that he's dreamed
All that he worked for
Every dream

Make his love, his compassion

Second time around she want more, I got it instore
Jazz flowin' in the back drop, I hit the jackpot
She went to yellin' Mac stop,

Your finger nails full of my skin, but it's a sin,
Cause everything good is bad for ya
In the sheets, nothing but heat,
Satisfing you, you satisfy me, it's like the ??? speaks
And I don't wanna end it,
It's kinda cool how are bodies blended, a third time is recommend
But you my woman so it's no guilt, we lay between the silk chillin'
It's over but we still trippin' off the feelin'
I'm a soldier, so I hold ya, them three words is what I told ya,
You smiled and tell me about the next time you coming over
See your mind is what I'm really sexin',
Your body just a source of erection, and plus I use protection
You never worry about the chicks approaching me at my show,
I be polite but you know I ain't really scoping them hoes
You never with another nigga cause you be with me,
And that's the way is supposed to be,
I got you in mind when you ain't close to me
And that's love.

You think about Mac between blinks,
Rub your hand through my kink, and tell me how your day went
Us againist the world, me and you girl
Go together like diamonds and pearl, a camoflague and war
I met ya through this chick I'm cool with so you gotta be real
And I can tell through the way that we chill
I can deal with cha, be real with cha, as we rise and shine,
Spending time like a 3 to 9
We in the park in the dark reminsicing and shit, kissing and shit,

Got a date a week from Friday with a preacher's son
Everybody says he's crazy
I'll have to see

I finally moved to Jackson when the summer came
I won't have to pay that boy to rake my leaves
I'm probably going on and on
It seems I'm doing more of that these days

I probably wouldn't be this way
I probably wouldn't hurt so bad
I never pictured every minute without you in it
Oh you left so fast
Sometimes I see you standing there
Sometimes it's like I'm losing touch
Sometimes I feel that I'm so lucky to have had the chance to love this much
God gave me a moment's grace
'Cause if I'd never seen your face
I probably wouldn't be this way

Mama says that I just shouldn't speak to you
Susan says that I should just move on
You oughta see the way these people look at me
When they see me round here talking to this stone
Everybody thinks I've lost my mind
But I just take it day by day

I probably wouldn't be this way
I probably wouldn't hurt so bad
I never pictured every minute without you in it
Oh you left so fast
Sometimes I see you standing there
Sometimes I feel an angel's touch
Sometimes I feel that I'm so lucky to have had the chance to love this much
God gave me a moment's grace
'Cause if I'd never seen your face

Which won't open far enough to let air in
The house wins
Oh, the house always wins

Feral cats are screaming at the clouds beneath the window
With the crack so small that nothing gets within
The house wins
Oh, the house always wins

You don't have to be alone to be lonely
You might as well give in

Telephones are howling at the cats out in the alley
And the window offers nothing in the din

Clouds uncage the car alarms to chase the cats and telephones
Fingers rake and rasp away their skin

And only one result has trickled in

If evil were a lesser breed than justice after all these years
The righteous would have freed the world of sin

Oh, what a long haul
You brought me here for this
I see nothing but disaster
Now I'm taking you with me, taking you with me.
A transparent scenery that comes as fast as it leaves.

Now my eyes flash with white
It's settling in with all the flickering
Here again, x2
The floor is more fitting for, the floor is more fitting for my face.
Here again? x2
This is getting old. x2
Here again? x2
I am being watched, this is overwhelming
Paranoia. x2

As you dig your feet in I will sink my teeth in the floor,
While I lay here alone.
As the light begins to breach the border,
While I lay here alone.

Aware of every step, I'm not aware at all, x2
Black. Flash white. x2
I am awake.

And we'd tried too many times before

And I spent the night alone
With three things on my mind
Money, pills, and girls
Money, thrills, and girls

Been looking through the pages of some magazine that I've read a thousand times
And the food all starts to taste the same and it's 6:09 AM
And there's nothing on TV
And I'm fucked, just look at me

Watching Simpsons, afraid to call you
I know I fucked up, I know I owe you
700, please don't hate me
I'll get a job and I'll pay you back somehow

One more night alone, and you can take it
There'll be more tomorrow
Same magazine, same tasteless food
Same TV screen, same shitty mood

And I feel like it can't get worse

It's Sean, once again, back it's Da Incredible Rap Team
Slap steam out your fuckin' physical frame

Rob a nigga for a buck and some change, play dice with that

Of you mutha fuckas with a backhand on the beat
He, he, he, I will mass transit strike down upon thee with massive vengeance
And ye will know that I am thee Lord, Rock, damn it

We came a little way from beats in the basements
Stick-up kids, throw the heat to your faces
And even though we don't be meetin' them cases

Hey you... did you ever realise what you'd become?
And did you see that it wasn't only me you were running from?
Did you know all the time but it never bothered you anyway
Leading the blind while I stared out the steel in your eyes?

You will find me
And if I climb above the stars
You are there

Through my tears I know
One thing remains

I am nothing
I am tired
I am torn in two

I've seen the lonely people
Crying out in the night
Screaming out for shelter
From the storms of this life

It breaks you in, it wears you down

We fear the world outside

In the background I can hear the trumpets singing their song so powerful, so elegant.
This is what scares me the most.
If I can't have her, who is there to carry her love across oceans?
She used to remind me that all is not lost,
As long as what you failed doing was something worth more than just your arrogant pride.
This is true my girl.
This is true.
I will always keep that in my mind, to open it.
To be reborn is to define the intent of finding bliss in tragedy.

Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?

Kneeling roses disappearing into Moses's dry mouth
Breaking into Fort Knox stealing our intentions
Hangars sitting dripped in oil, crying freedom
Handed to obsoletion, still you feed us lies from the tablecloth

La-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la, ooh

Everybody's going to the party have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowin' up the sunshine

Well everybody's going to the party have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowin' up the sun-

Where the fuck are you?
Where the fuck are you?

Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?

111,"Went down to Mexico
I drove my black El Camino
I met up with an old gringo
He showed me round, and said to call him Joe
I was there about a week or so
Wound up in the general hospital
Joe said don't drink the water no more
How the hell was I supposed to know?

Drove up to San Diego
Saw a sign for Mission Beach
And so, went way out deep into the ocean
Saw a shark and had a stroke
Back in the ambulance I go
I had a dream about a girl I used to know
She said ""I got to warn ya bout Mexico and California""
She said ""I got to warn ya bout Mexico and California""
Oh, yeah
She said ""I got to warn ya bout Mexico and California""

Earthquakes and sharks to start us off
If Chupacabras ain't enough
Black widow spiders and killer bees
There ain't no shade, there ain't no trees
Hot desert heat and polluted air
And traffic jams beyond compare
That's all I got to warn ya bout Mexico and California

Woke up and said I got to go
Doc said ""Relax, and take it slow""
I tried to argue, but don't you know
Bout California and Mexico?
Right then, the doctor hit the floor
The building shook, then shook some more
I looked down at him and swore
""You son of a bitch! I told you so!""

Earthquakes and sharks to start us off
If Chupacabras ain't enough
Black widow spiders and killer bees
There ain't no shade, there ain't no trees
Hot desert heat and polluted air
And traffic jams beyond compare

112,"It's been so long
And tin cans and string for years
Is all that we've known
Could it be you're really here?

'Cause my eyes are open
And everything still moves in slow-motion
Breathless and blue
And behind your eyes the sea
Oceans of light envelop me

But things can't be as they seem
I'm so far from home
This must be another dream

But my eyes are open
And everything still moves in slow-motion
Breathless and blue

Oceans of light envelop me

113,"The credits roll, the camera pans
And in the mist our hero stands
He starts to speak, then folds his hands in prayer
An awkward pause, then ""What's my line?""
There's nothing left to say this time
And what would you say to a bad guy who's not there?
In terms of Roman numerals,
He's IV league with Roman Polanski
He'd win an Oscar every time if he was only given the chance

He started on the Broadway stage
A product of another age
An offer and a pilot drew him west
The series bombed, commercials came
And though nobody knew his name
They all recognized the potential he possessed
Deodorants and dental floss
And how much does that new car cost
His acting most methodical in You Don't Need a Medical
He's branded like a racing car,
He's like a movie star without movies.
The week of Independence Day
The casting agent called to say
Your smile could save our movie and the world

Buy buy buy buy
Sell sell sell
How well you learn
To not discern
Who's foe, and who is friend
We'll own them all in the end

It goes like this, we have no choice 
The minarets, the wailing voice
And vaguely Celtic music fills the air
We choose a foreigner to hate
The new Iraq gets more irate
We really know nothing about them, and no one cares
Aladdin and the forty thieves
Enhanced by brand new special effects
Saddam and his cow disease spiced up
With some gratuitous sex
A movie's made, a war is won
A low-speed chase, a smoking gun
Distracts us while the actor takes the stand

Buy buy buy buy
Sell sell sell
How well you learn
To not discern
Who's foe and who is friend
We'll own them all in the end

Check it out

(Don't turn away, I think you should listen) -- &gt; MC Lyte

Well I'm the one for my treble, two for my bass
3, 4, 5 just to stay on pace
Now that I got your attention you'll be happy to know
That they call me Tee the King but King Tee's how it goes
So suckers, get your shit and get packed
Catch the next boat out, supreme Tela's back
And I'm funky once agaian, so run and tell a friend
They said I wouldn't last but I'll be here until it ends
Yo, I'm the king at being cool but get a load of this
They wanna label me best L.A. soloist
I couldn't be like that, but then again I could
Cause half of you MC's ain't no good
Anyway, hey, I got somethin' to say
Directed to every MC in L.A.
You run up on the King - huh, how dumb
You knew from the beginning you shoulda brung a gun, son
'Cause I be shootin the gift like it's a gift
Take the punk, slide 'em up just like a spliff (*inhales*)
Then everything's cool and copastetic
I wrote the book on being cool - oh, you read it?
How'd you like the part where I tell you how to walk
The kinda clothes to wear, the use of slang in your talk?
No need to look around cause there ain't no clone
King Tee came to take you home
Come on

Now this tune right here allows you to get funky
Literally you can do what you want, see?
I'm more like the pilot or the driver of the scene
Or somethin' that you usually dream
Yeah, I'm manufacturin the sickest metaphor
Lyrics you're not ready for
Hear it, I keep a steady score
Of suckers and muthafuckas who like to suffer
I wear big ropes in clusters
And I execute, never wore a sexy suit
I wear khakis with a t-shirt and hiking boots
A rare fashion with the gangster touch
Because Ballys don't mix and turtlenecks suck
But hey, I be crashin, throw in a accent
Maxin while I'm waxin the boots with passion
Happens to be one of my favorite attractions
The name's King Tee, but the T's for taxin
Phoney MC's, them sucker punks wanna riff
Just because I wanna give the party a lift
You know, build your spirits expand your horizon
This particular production is mine's
And E-Swift's, the DJ E-Swift to be exact
Holds a hypnotizin scratch, make the others look wack
So look all you want cause there ain't no clone

Come on

Stress to smoke.

To fuck with MC Ren,

You see them niggas be bitchy because
I won't let 'em up on my team
And give 'em a title like Hakeem,
I'm peelin' caps like tangerines
Tellin' niggas I should
Break 'em off chips
Get 'em in clubs free
And take 'em on trips
Free-Loadin' ass niggas
Lose all they sense
When they think they gon' floss
Off my expense
Niggas be goin' corner to corner
Bringin' up the bill
Askin questions like the popos
Tryin' to see if I made a mill'
Then they take that weak shit
Back to they home fo' pillow ??
She shakin' her head like you tellin' the truth
But she want yo' ass to walk
What the fuck you expected?
Always bitchin' at me
When she fuckin' yo' ass,
Nigga she be seein me.
Go look in the room,
A costume, fo' haloween,
Of that black nigga, you know who
So you can live yo' dream

I hear yo' ho punk bitches talkin' shit,
Tryin' to have some say
Tellin' other hoes they wouldn't
Give me no time of day
Still livin' with they mommy
She babysittin' while you fuckin'
Gettin' county cheques and money
From them niggas that you dick suckin
But nigga, why these bitches all in mine?
Why, nigga, hearin bullshit all the time?
Hoes from high school be wishin

You know how they be in the car-hop clicks,
Muthafuckin' tricks
Now these hoes jockin'

It's kind of frightening 
'Cause it's too soon to be sure

Maybe even might be love 

Should I be patient
Or should I ask her straight out 
That smile she gave me 
Don't leave too much room for doubt
I think she likes me 
Maybe even might be love 

Our first kiss said more than good night
I bet I've relived it a thousand times
I can't predict what the future's gonna bring
But those looks that she's been giving me
Can only mean one thing

The best is still yet to come

A goddamn crying shame
Eyes to see with, ears to hear

Trapped in their own heads

I would wish that I were dead

I love the lights that shines
And the sound that's all around (2x)

I don't imagine I'll go
Never wanted to be that way,
I never wanted to be this way

I complain about my looks
I feel bad 'bout my hair
Jesus, that's so sad, I admit it now
Why should anyone care?
Let me be your ears, your eyes
Your legs, I'm what you need
I can't go on living this life
Wrapped in my own greed

I love the lights that shines

It's hard to do and say what's right

I see my world has changed
The sun won't rise this mornin'

Yesterday I could tell myself
That she'd be back for sure
But that train don't stop here anymore
Anymore

She used to go out with the girls
Every now and then
She always came home early
We'd jump in bed by ten
She'd tell me that she loved me
She would forevermore
But that train don't stop here anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, alright

Nothin' changes faster than baby's fickle mind
I know she's lovin' someone
Somewhere down the line
I know that she still has a key
I'm waiting by the door
But that train don't stop here anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, alright

She ran out through the back door
Screamin' in the night
She said I was the devil
I didn't treat her right
That man down at the station
Said ""That was her for sure""
Now that train don't stop here anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, ah shucks

My hands miss you 
The stars sing, I've got their song in my head 

Blue in the broad light of day 
Your claws are snagged on my face

I'm a, hood legend, you should feel threatened
Front I'ma show you what's good in a second
The best in the business, I mean what is it?
The dopest MC to walk talk it and live it
A wide bright screen with a blockbuster signature
Every new line I speak should be in cinemas
Champion sound, I win with words
Like you finally talked your girl into sleepin' with a friend of hers
Oh yeah, I'm off on a good one
Momma's so proud of what her boy from the hood done
Got off the meat and I got my mind right, I
Got out these streets I got my grind like I
Got on these beats I gotta come tight it's
Gotta be me, it's gotta be 9th
Your boy dropped some stuff and it was probably nice
But they need a little help, and a lot of advice
Quit while you're ahead, you ain't seein no bread and
Don't sleep on us, you can sleep when you're dead
And grateful, you didn't live life hateful
Change for the better like the weather in April
Food for the soul, go ahead and grab a plateful
A heart full of hate, is a waste and disgraceful
Uh, don't ingest, turn your stomach
When a brother only wanna see another brother plummet
Come wit'cha best and you can lose like the rest
Straight shots when I shoot how we do on the West
Yeah!

(Murs)
You know who we might be, man myth or MC
But Murs sums it up best now, wouldn't you agree?
I, stuck to the plate like it's And1 and straight
Sew the mic around your neck and then bounce it off your face
With grace, the ace in the hole, replacin the old
Cause the new generation got a taste for some soul
Hold on to opinions till I tell you to have one
That mic wasn't hot until the spot till I grabbed one
Off the stand now it's off the hook
And when the beat is this nuts, then I'm off the books
Meaning, off the head, freestylin makin' bread
And I shoulda been in a movie but I made my own instead
Still pioneering with this independent hustle
And your mic cord is much too short for you to tussle
For the man that pro like 40-Water, poured in remembrance
Of every hood soldier that died in ghetto tenements
Innocent till proven guilty
Should I die don't look for the dude that killed me
Look for a brighter tomorrow, and in spite of the sorrow
Live every moment to the fullest so your life isn't hollow
And you can holla out my name from the top of the game
And since you passed homey I promise I'll do the same
For if a soul is avenged through the deeds of a friend
Then success has always been the best form of revenge
The end

No, they
Violated you

Something primal, something strong
Can't escape
And those who did you wrong
I hunt like prey

And it burns inside
The need to kill - I'm driven by
The crimson tide
Meet my demon, meet my Hyde

I was the only one who knew
Who held you
The system doesn't hear
Nobody will listen to
I will see that they all know
What you felt
And I just hate them so
Hate them, I hate

And it burns inside
The need to kill - I'm driven by
The crimson tide
Meet my demon, meet my Hyde

And it burns inside (I burn alive)

And for the hauntings in the night

As they lie in the dirt
Begging, pleading for their lives
I cover them slowly

And if we make it then we'll be just fine
Maybe you'll be yours and I'll be mine

There's always mischief, oh you know the devil's always prying,
Now being good to you is all that's on my mind
Down

Yes your mind gets like a villain, make you splinter
Sing your heart off walking through some long Russian winter
Crying at the sad stories in the paper and on the news
Then I gather up the scattered blessings
To bring them back to you.

Turn it on, switch it on

Go on and turn it up, turn it on, turn it over

Praise be the hands that brought this to work now
Turn it on, switch it on.

Just sing a song it's true

A wise man will hear and increase learnings
And a man of understanding will obtain wise council
To understand a proverb individually
The words of the wise and the riddles
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge
But fools despise the wisdom and instruction
Heed the instructions of your father
And do not foresake the law of your mother
For they will be graceful way beyond your head
And chains about your neck

Worldwide, look
All of my pain is on the pictures in my enemy's frame
Written in blood, my ambition is driven by thugs
Got two glock nines and I fill them with slugs
Call me Saint Valentine, 'cause when I kill 'em, it's love
Say my name, Masada, life full of pain and drama
Bloodstains and horror, here my voice out the Hell flames, I hollar
I write with the pen of the reaper, stare in my eyes
Look deeper, now turn into stone, it's Medusa
Reduce your flesh into bones, prey upon your dead meat like a vulture
Dig out your eyes, send your soul to Hell
While your body is covered in flies
Spazz like John the Revelator trippin' off of acid
The desperate man with a handful of Tarrots
I'm the ghost of Mozart, possessed my arm
The blood of Tupac drip from the pen in my palm
Stain the paper, swirl it around, see the vision
A thousand profits locked in prison
Free 'em all with the rhyme, short sentence
Unlock 'em from my brain cells, plague the Earth
40 nights of rain and Hell, Masada, spell my name in braille

(Luminati)
He who despises the Lord will destroyed
But he who fears the coming will be rewarded
The law of the wise is the foundation of life
To turn one away from the spirits of death
Poverty and shame will come to him who withstands correction
But he will dodge a refute will be honored
He who walks with wise men will be wise
But the companion of fools will be destroyed

(Killah Priest)
I post up in front of the world, witness my pearls
Unleashin the masterpiece, actions twirl
Like a twister, the riddler, picture my moment
Filling scriptures with my niggaz
I pour the liquor on my own, trick!
Bullshit, until the apocalypse hit
Laughin' with the angels, just watchin the shit
Hands out your pockets bitch, the glock'll spit
Leave the Earth in turmoil when I'm poppin' clips
Kill the devil, I'm the rebel lost in the streets
My only fears is when I sleep, I'll be tossin' deep
Or if the woman in my arms think of crossin the Priest
Proverbs, God words, nigga I'm talkin' to thee

(Luminati)
Let's reverse the way of the righteousness
In the midst of a passive justice
I can establish the everlasting from the beginning
Before there was ever an Earth
Blessed is the man who listens to me
Watching daily at my gates waiting at the posts of my doors
For who shall revise me for his life and obtains favor from the Lord
But he who sins against me warrants his own soul
And all those who hate me love death

(Killah Priest)
Telekinesis, I see through dreams
A conqueror of all world like the Hebrew kings
I'm David, reincarnated over again
A gladiator of the universe, a soldier of men
A warlord across the field, returnin from battle
With blood upon my shield with an arm full of arrows
I'm a warrior, elephants kneels as I pass
Holdin' skeletons of the soldiers that I killed in my path
With the heads of their leaders still in my hands
Hold it up, lightnin strikes, brightens the night
Turn my hair whitened like Christ then flash out of sight
Head back to the cemetery, my job is done
Volume one, Priest, part two is when God will come

Choices of wickedness brought me nothing
But righteousness delivered from death
The Lord will not soften a soul from righteous to fairest
For he casts away the substance of the wicked

Yeah, 7th Vail (7th Vail)
Kool Keith, the prince of New York
My man... H-Bomb
Like no other
My breed is no other
The world fashion instructor
New wave gator conductor
My name written on the back of your hiphuggers
Gotta handle that flashes
Adjust my speed shutter
Futuristic vocalist, Kool Keith
I'm pro at this
I'm too high up in the sky
Many are lower at this
Girls look out the colossal windows
It's on when the wind blows
Scroll through your bank accounts, I'm not a pimp
You wanna give me your pocketbook
I'm not a violatin guy, I'm not a pocket crook
The empire of all this
People say what kinda style you call this
My sparkle shine, it's all wrist
(Uh-huh, it's all wrist)

(Chorus - singer)
Your girlfriend got in me mayn
She been givin' me brains
There's no shame in her game
But you should be ashamed (I'm the prince of New York)
You see I'm runnin' thangs
Got diamond rings and chains
See I move in big ways
I like the finer thangs (I'm the prince of New York)

(Uncredited rapper)
From age 14 I been walkin' this talk
Fuck Bill Cosby, I'm with the prince of New York
In ninety-four, {?} play with Eric B.
Left {?} for the West coast from Jersey
And that's the time where about Big and 'Pac
The time on the mic, niggaz had to rock
Don't cuss the Lord 'cause he had blessed
Some distressed from the shine on the chest
The men remain, many get slain
Flipped perks for personal gain, money woodgrain
I changed the code, I save a load
I've crossed the road and L.A. showed
The flyest chicks, the dopest whips
The cush is the shit, out of town is flipped
Your hustle stopped cause you can not
Do what I do so you chill with a half knot

(Kool Keith)
The National Enquirer, tornado mister
Essence Magazine
You the model with the nice legs in sister to sister
You got a little resume with Mannie Fresh
So you worked a couple of videos
For Mario Winans and Tung Twista
Who's your contact? And who should I call back?
Turn around girl, all I see is a wineglass shape
It's nice right there, the thong gets lost
I see all back
I'm tellin' your man, I'm all that
The industry bore me, y'all all whack
I created Hustler, I ball back
When I shop, I'm all back

I don't care no more about your lyrics
The average MC is bullshit, I don't hear it
Fuck you talkin' about you rap with a good spirit
I make rappers intimidated
Over wack-ass beats they get motivated, some have ministrated
Even suburban kids copy your shit and duplicate it
My balls you now cherish

Type of muthafucka to eat a lotta celery
Your CD was butter-soft - what you tellin' me?
A bunch of 'N Sync type of fans hyped you up like Bill Bellamy

Niggas with real shit will hurt you

Erase your shit, I don't dub you

148,"Woke up this morning, rain coming down
Washing the sin from the street
Sometimes I feel like I'm losing ground
Just trying to make ends meet
Well I work every day to sweat out my dreams
Won't you show me that you understand
It's only my life, whatever that means
And you've got it all in your hands

I need someone to pull me through
Won't you take the pain from my head
Give me all your loving, the way you always do
Give me breakfast in bed

I feel like the good days are numbered
And my nights are getting too long
My hopes and my fears take their toll on the years
And my willpower's almost gone
Well it's a time full of trouble
A time of desperate need
Sometimes life don't make sense
Fighting the anger, jealousy and greed
One day I'll look back and wonder where it all went

I need someone to pull me through
Won't you take the pain from my head
Give me all your loving, the way you always do
Give me breakfast in bed

It don't take much to please me
I'm just a simple man
Won't you please believe me
I gotta tell you
It don't take much - a tender touch
So baby do the best that you can

149,"On a dark street, on a cold night
Pizza's cooking in a storefront oven
On the corner a boy is waiting
The moonlight feels cold and desperate

Some hidden sadness is bound down
Attention lives all over town
Ready to burst open into driving
Burning, exploding sound

If these walls could sing
They'd sing us a hundred songs
If these walls could talk
They'd say they've seen it coming all along

Tony's making slice pies for the lunch rush
Stirring the sauce, pounding out the dough
His brother left town with his girl
She ain't his girl no more

And some days, they seem to never end
So mundane in this old town
Ready to burst open into driving
Burning, exploding sound

If these walls could sing
They'd sing us a hundred songs
If these walls could talk
They'd say they've seen it coming all along

May all these walls we've made
In our wasted years and days
Not stand in our way
That we may feel the winds of change

If these walls could sing
They'd sing us a hundred songs
If these walls could talk
They'd say they've seen it coming all along

If these walls could sing
They'd sing us a hundred songs
If these walls could talk
They'd say they've seen it coming, coming, coming, coming, coming all along

150,"He was selling postcards from a paper stand
A whiskey bottle in his withered hand
He put a finger on a photo from an old magazine
And saw himself in the shadow of his dream

They found him with his head inside a tin-pot crown
Told him his feet stank and took him downtown
Called him agitator, spy and thief
Shut him up in solitary third degree
Take a long line, reel him in

He tried to appeal to the king of might
He said ""I'm just excercising my sacred right""
The king he said ""You ain't got no rights
You're a madman, a traitor, get outta my sight""
Take along line, reel him in

They put him aboard a well wound whirlwind
Pulled out his teeth and rold him to grin
He gave them a smile, pulled out a bottle of wine
And said ""I never existed, you've been wasting your time""
Take a long line, reel him in

151,"A restless eye across a weary room
A glazed look and I was on the road to ruin
The music played and played as we whirled without end
No hint, no word her honour to defend

<i>""I will, I will,""</i> she sighed to my request
And then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put to the test
Then drowned in desire, our souls on fire
I lead the way to the funeral pyre
And without a thought of the consequence
I gave in to my decadence

One slip and down the hole we fall
It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason
That binds a life for life
A small regret, you won't forget
There'll be no sleep in here tonight

Was it love, or was it the idea of being in love?
Or was it the hand of fate that seemed to fit just like a glove?
The moment slipped by and soon the seeds were sown
The year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone

One slip and down the hole we fall
It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason
That binds a life to a life
You won't regret, you will never forget
There'll be no sleep in here tonight

One slip ... one slip

152,"These last few weeks there's been lots of talk about the past
About the true loves we've all lost and the ones we never had
Vicariously reliving the pain of saying goodbye to you
Has left me wondering exactly what you've been up to
I've long since gotten over the aftermath of my mistakes
Had pointed out to me the error of my ways
But the little things keep showing up inside my mind
And a better friend than you were I don't think that I can find
But now seeing you again
Reminds me thankfully of why the bar was raised so high
I'm not writing you this song
To say I want you back it's simply that I hope I'll never lose you again
I think about the days we spent together
I come to realize it's all blurry and I can't remember
All that much except how happy we both were back then
And how these days I'm not even sure if I can call you friend

I'm giving unease to anyone I meet,

Because I give a gift from what's within myself.

Take nothing from nothing and you'll have nothing left.
(I can't recall.)
I can't recall a moment in my life when life was at it's best.

Everyone avoids my stare and no one cares to ever dare
To look into my eyes of what they most fear.
And they're taught to fear, to fear no evil.
And they know no fear, they've learned to love themselves.

(No hope at all.)
Take nothing from nothing and you'll have nothing left.
(I can't recall.)
I can't recall a moment in my life when life was at it's best.

Forever unlucky, 'cause I'll own tomorrow.
Forever unwanted, outcast today.
I'm not mislead, I've got no one to follow.
Everywhere to go, no place to stay.

Take nothing from nothing and you'll have nothing left.

I can't recall a moment in my life when life was at it's best.

Every daily grades let it be the reason
My Cleveland niggas revolve like dead bodies
In Eden leading seeping
And I don't wanna rock the pump
But I doubt it if I have ta pop the trunk

Rolling wid my bucks in the biggest snatch shit

Smoking up bud and fucking up blunts

Wid the nines and beams the philly and green
Wid a clik tight team and a nigga like me

Eyes bloodshot red when I floss instead
I rather run up and smash you wid a passion

You brothers blow wind in your gat

You're all that keeps me awake
The summer is passing much faster than winter
But we all remember winter's mistake
This island is calling and screaming your name
Screaming baby come home

And I'll stay awake through sunrise
Cause babe that's the closest to your eyes

Y mi sangre alimenta tu ser
La lujuria de mis alas
Roza tus pechos y ara&#241;a tu piel

Bebe! Embriaga tus vicios
Decide! Orgasmos o amor
La &#250;nica Iglesia que ilumina es la que arde
El Nazareno duerme en su Cruz

Quiero estar junto a ti y alimentar tu boca
Hay veces que el dolor, duerme en una canci&#243;n

Yeah, our secret space, at will

Shut your eyes, I'll spin the big chair
And you'll feel dizzy, light and free
And falling gently on the cushion

Lose ya man in a tussle, but y'all don't see me
Y'all can't hear me, this a def jam, call me Russell, man
I played on Martin, call me hustle, man
And now y'all know I'm the yee-yo muscle, man
But on the under, I got that wonder, to stop that thunder
That rumble in the side of ya stomach, piled on water
How do you want it, come through in a Coupe powder blue or
High with water, how do you want it man
Ay, I towed a lot of tullies dun, I den broke a lot of hoopties dun

190,"Electric charge comin' from the mainframe
I'm from where the phat beats stretch for mad blocks

My every little step set in a star,
Retina Scarred; tread in a sled of bedbugs got my dead head in a jar
Crazer camp stamp blank on the mug of settlers registered not protest nor approval regarding every morn futile.
My experience with a spirit alignment interference assigns division from clearance to ample scrambling.
Let's note the magnificence in the difference.
OK see two canaries on the wire aspire to separate luulabies both of which had me drifting.
Every clan ghostly orphan scared stiff in the bliss and list picking from the arrangement under burden. Bust.
Wallow in will to split the privelage cluster; Lackluster as if a journey choice grew on the nearest chuckle path- dispatch trouble.
I've never seen the water so high in my poison life. Social conduct, 20 pace, about face, self destruct. I know the key locations, sharp enough to catch those subtle signs cause, well, this here alley cat's been around the block a couple of times.
Lifting every tin can, sifting every mess; one man's trash, you know the rest, live it.
Pitching a battered platform out of mass hysterics perished in the blizzard. When it's finished I plan to sit and observe the twister pivot.
Sleep and sleep well; sleep with a sacred array of fevers, wake as a pertinent version of a pipe dreamer.
Y'all can find me if you lookin' for a friend- I'll be the only iron-clad oracle in a city of tin.

(It's like that)

I was born where crooked demeanor seemed to spawn merit; I was born where all the king's men couldn't mend a broken spirit; I was born where it don't matter if you stand, sit, or fall, to live and die as a brick brick brick in the wall. And I'm a brick brick brick brick brick in the wall, and I'm a brick brick brick brick brick in the wall. And I'm a brick in the wall, drop in the bucket, yes y'all.

Spare a match for the most distorted orchid in the path.
Assorted orphans coursed in a morbid orbit forward toward the traps.
I make a tentative promise to flash frequent the most sacred abrasive based in allegiance to the makeshift mason's secrets.
Water basin leaking, plug it up.
The simple triple ring performance shoveled subtle imperfection.
I rung a life's worth of saturated costume gear over hell's balcony to nullify the drought and still the martyr farmers shout at me.
And so the epic went.
And every cirrus hung.
The bow breakers turned a cradle fatal, every spirit clung.
Croon for the slick Icarus brain children busy splitting the givingtree building fresh canoes for freaks to cross the spill in. I'm frantic.
My plan is dwindling with every pulse bump. Gods and monsters yield the lump sum of the dolt clump.
Be wary when the stratosphere tints.
I Scout like Atticus Finch, inching up slow in the games of reconnaissance.
Now cause to amend the Zen memorandum has surfaced in every holocaust citadel fix it plan.
12 easy steps to better picket line demeanor.
Gumshoe.
Stick stone conglomerate activate massive.
But the sky is falling. F-f-f-fuck you.
I've hired sweatshop labor to hold candles to the solar panels stitched in the back of my neck for nickels and sour milk by the week.
Cheek to the heartache.
At the center of my anthem lies a blend of temper tantrums substantial for me to lamp in.

I'm known global, blooded out pimp by coastal
Rap mobile, low key, anti-social
Smoke gray Timbs, criss fade, wave to sin
White Denali, teared it up, flagrant rims
I'm no thief, I live by the code of the streets
I hold heat, but no need to go in the deep
Don for real with the same gotti traumata pill
Von o niel, embraced by the arms of the ill
Art of war, a hundred men, cars galore
Wanted men, who couldn't see in robbin the law

And I can show you how to take cash and bribe the cops
And from the bars to the backyards, alleys and aves

Blow with me, I'm like the life of that old 50
I dose quickly, moves is so shifty
Days been broke, on corners with them trays of coke
It was the dirty hustle money that raise my folks
Tights from jail, few niggas might see bail
It's kinda foul when you watch niggas wifies tell
Flip-on who?, I still wore wrist on blue
Y'all know my style, M.I.A. but I miss y'all too
Tryin' to remain breathin, hot blocks never change seasons
Bodies get caught for the strangest reasons
Breath the smoke, and time for me is need to coke
Won't stop till I stack it all and flee the coast

Wait till the Heny' hit me, hope that sin lift me
Never smile, style is wild, only grin strictly
Your main supplier, for days in the same retier
Sat and watch niggas used to get it again and expire
Deep in thought, spit it like a street report
I rep alone still I stand without no feet support
Fuck the threats, I rip necks of suckin a tech
Either that or ice picks stuck in ya neck

Dead the jokes I'm near when the bread get boast
So fuck me, ask your bitch who get head the most

I don't know where to begin, but I'll start with the radical leaders

(And as clowns you follow suit behind the blood between the red and white and blue but it's too deep for you to see and
Everyone eventually will take the step 'cause it's in sight you take the left I'll take the right I feel the hate you've built

Like a plague fed to the brain, deadly disease

And as they're feeding your mind with this shit you forget
How to speak how to ask all the questions

The business at hand tonight, make the people choose
(I see another side in you but there's not much more I can do from on the outside looking in your government is listenin' to

Don't give them all the power when your future's in desperate trouble baby

As they thank the Lord the blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain, deadly disease
I'd run away tonight with my mind still intact you gotta make it all right
Easier said than done with no place to hide and having no place to (run)
Running away from condition, I see you but you're running away from
You're scared seductive system

Most would claim I live a lie when pointing out it's easy to predict these things
Every color has its side, they live together vote and most won't read between these lines
Please help us, please save us of course they have control we're all the same
Up on the cross, crucified their problem drove the nail and let Him rot
Family and friends, it won't matter in the end I'm sure they'll understand
Now look at the world and see how the humans bleed
As I sit up here and wonder bout how you sold your mind, body and soul
Looking at the fields so green I know this sounds obscene
I see you're living for tomorrow but decisions you have made will leave you empty

As they thank the Lord the blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain, deadly disease
I'd run away tonight with my mind still intact you gotta make it all right

203,"Deaf eyes seem to watch
The actions of definition
Human mockery.
Persuasions never made me
Feel so sickened.
Where's your action?
Spent stabbing aimlessly
At walls with your fists
As apparitions.
They do what they do
Because this lonely town
Feels like hospital beds,
And you let them.
I've broke my hands for
Less than this.
There's nothing left
To justify to you.
With every breath that
I exhale I wonder what it's
Like to feel alive.
Maybe it's only in this light,
But you're not a victim
No consequence
Breeds no conscience.

The path lay before me
Illuminated by
The blood of those
Who went
The hard way

Silence appressive
Death imminent
Chaotic evil
Raping the order
Killing the light

Submit to your fears
Obsessed with your faults
Surrender to the darkness within
Initializing Armageddon
End of transmission

Massa di requiem per tellus
Amanged for choir and flesh
An eldritch chaos of demon cacophony
Such sweet disharmony
Almost sacred
In its blasphemy

Now...
To rest
To die
Sleep...
Perchance to dream
Of nightmares and coffin-worm

Such sprrow, then
To wake up
To be alive
Not dreaming
In a corpsecity beneath the waves...

Infernal Winter
No way to recapture the feeling
Cannot reclaim a crumbled throne
Cursed with awareness
Of a time that has died

Detached I sever the bonds
Adoming my shell with crimson threads
Attuning my flesh to my spirit
Revelling in the agony

My breath is chill
My blood is ice
My embrace the freezing death
Frozen to the core
Subzero emotions
So cold it burns

Let the cold penetrate you
Let the cold penetrate you
Let the cold... all the way... in.

Fall into the dirty water, time after time.

We went down to the water's edge.
And now there's nothing but grains of sand.

The signal flashes faintly from the shore.
Echoes in the distance with, the sound of your voice.
Nothing has ever seemed so far away.
Wave after wave, it's calling me.
Wave after wave after wave...

Every single song was once alive, just like the two of us.
We step into the shallow end to see what love is like.
At the waters edge our lives were shut.
The tide keeps rolling out.
But now we're nothing.
Now you're nothing but grains of sand.

We mobbin' on you muthafuckas!

(Verse 1: Celph Titled)
Yeah
If there's one thing for certain, Celph Titled's a serpent
Put on this earth on purpose to change the ocean's current
Into tidal waves and lava, Secret government labs in Nevada
Found fragments of my sentence and died instant
From an infant to an emperor
Dead Sea Scrolls mixed with gangsta shit, my literature
Annihilate entire societies, nothin' left to salvage
Next mornin', loungin' on a tropic beach, gettin' drunk, talkin' about it
We might move in silence, not revealin' our plot
No alcohol in your system, but you'll be feelin' the shots
So many pistols, I'm the 45 King
Yes the Pharaohs is the new Flavor Unit, it's a fortified thing
And it's ""A"" 'cause we animals, ""O"" 'cause we ominous
""T"" 'cause we tyrants and, ""P"" 'cause we're prominent
On all continents, our contents incite mosh pits
Products of our environment, we Designed to be Violent
And the Hologram showed you that, the prophecy was golden
The Torture Papers, hands catch on fire when they hold it
The game's changed, now there's more than 5 Perfect Exerters
Hang my portrait on the wall and you can frame me for murder

I'm a arson, y'all live y'all lives in coffins
I can hear y'all hatin' (The walls are thin)
Apathetic, call the paramedics, we had to set it
It's a war of words, they got lost inside the sentence
I'm diggin' graves, put the switch to my blade
Shank a nigga just for lookin' at me, get up on stage
When I say ""Throw your hands up,"" better keep 'em up
'Cause niggas is creepin' up with heaters up
And nigga, you soft, I'll take you to lunch and feed you a corpse
Wash it down with OE, see nigga, I boss
Celph bring guns and smoke, I bring rum and the coke
Love my wife, that's why I never had no love for a ho
What, you don't know? I spit it with a propane flow
Cocaine-to-the-nose rap, that's why Plan' about to blow
So let's go, take a walk with a menace
Alcoholic nigga, showin' 40's love like tennis

(Verse 3: Apathy)
I'm the product of angels and demons, cocaine and weedin'
Eight different reasons the A-P is breathin'
Language I'm speakin' is ancient as Eden
Where snakes had Eve eatin' Satan's semen
A top dollar pharmaceutical block scholar
Pop my collar like a bionic rottweiler
Molecules dissolve, I pass through walls
Solidify on the other side, grab my balls
I'm the shit, bitch, flip bricks bigger than Egyptians
Dragged across sand to expand my shipment
Shapes are shiftin', liftin' more weight than pistons
Attila the Hun with a gun, keep your distance
Toss UFO's and foes like a discus
The size of Godzilla, dick bigger than bridges
Wicked as a wizard with a liquid elixir
Stick to the script, I'm spittin' the unholiest scripture
And y'all are just now goin' through your thug phase
While I blast like flash grenades in drug raids
Try to criticize me, you little rappin'-ass groupie
Y'all as corny as muthafuckas who clap at the movies
The Army of the Pharaohs, checks with six ceros
Try to walk in my shoes and pop your Nike Air soles
There's no mercy, so of course the haters
Will get my autograph on The Torture Papers

Lost inside a memory
Thinking of all the good times gone by
But that was yesterday's high

No longer looking for the new thing

Wasted too much time
Chasing dragons in our dreams

There was a time we had so little
And a little was enough
It took some time, but now we see
Everything's inside of us

We're still believing
No longer looking for the new thing

With a half a million dollars right in my motherfuckin face

Put in another clip, 'cause I ain't givin' up a motherfucker

And I been sleepin' in this motherfucker all night
I started pullin on my hoe
""C'mon man what?"" Wake up bitch, we gotta go!
Pulled out the alley, then I dipped
Looked down and picked up the nine and put more rounds in the clip
You know I'm headin South no doubt
And I don't give a fuck where, as long it's a hideout
Finally we crossed the border, I pulled into a station
To fill up the tank, and get a drink of water
Pullin over to park my ride
That's when I noticed this limousine comin' up on my left side
Then the sucker started rammin me
Then I looked, it was the Luciano family
Looked at my bitch she started cryin, my finger on the trigger
I pulled it -- bullets started flyin
Now I'm hittin all them bastards
I'm droppin' 'em fast, splashin blood out niggaz asses

I took 'em all out, but I caught one in the stomach
Now I'm lookin' for survivors
So I ran up on the side of the car, and hit the driver
And then I laid low
The only motherfucker left was Don Luciano
So I snuck up the sucker
Put my gun to his head, ""Whassup now motherfucker?""
He said, ""Wait, I want to talk""
*Five gunshots* I put his brains on the sidewalk
Another life I had to waste
He fell on his back, and then I spit right in his guinea face
He saw the barrel of the devil's gun
Now I'm no longer on the motherfuckin run

Most definitely
We up in here
Boot Camp Clik
On the beat...
TY Dizzle
Ah
One Shot Deal
Duck Down in this muthafucka once again
Let's do this

(VERSE 1: Top Dog)
(You) thought I was finished, you thought I was done
'Cause I took time off to raise my son
But I rep for the streets, prepared with the heat
The Top Dog will rhyme over any beat
Yeah, you rep for the hood, that's all to the good
My dogs get high off Henn and backwood
I got love for the game but some of you lames
Get me sick tryin' to sound the same
But I do what I do, carry the flame
Like the last child tryin' to carry the name
I'ma rep for my stripes, that's word to my life
Like you coward cops tryin' to take my life

(VERSE 2: Louieville)
Yo, I'm just tryin' to do me, high as fuck
Countin' up bucks, baby boy's lackin trucks
Tryin' to live through all the bullshit
Addin up chips, a nigga tryin' to get rich
And when I'm aggravated I smoke heavenly
Drink heavenly until the loss of memory
It's the Vi-double to the l-e
Movin out where it's warm when it's chilly

(VERSE 3: Buckshot)
The god is back to put the r in rap
No R&amp;B niggas, the streets don't want a part of that
Become hard for the game, some starve for the game
Some don't get the picture till they a part of the frame
Just cool it, mane, it's simple and plain
Yeah, I'm from Brooklyn but I live in this game
Still the same and I do the thang like it never was done
This little nigga move ahead of the gun
So what you sayin'?

(CHORUS: Buckshot)
Everyday all day
(I'm) with my niggas
(Just) hangin' out
(Just) coolin out
(Just) on the regular
(I'm) with my niggas
(Just) hangin' out
(Just) coolin out
(Just) sober for now but
(I'm) rollin' up
(Just) hangin' out
(Just) coolin out
(Just) everbody together
(I'm) lovin' it
(Just) hangin' out
Coolin out

(VERSE 4: Tek)
Tek son, it's time that you're free
It been nights I ain't sleep
Too busy worried about the moves in the street
We send flames down the base of your spine
We lose one but we killed two, catch you while you're out on your grind
A nigga gotta get bloody every once in a row
Give it and go, let it out, it's good for the soul
How you're talkin' but you can't understand it
I'm 'bout my money, mane, and I gets respect 'cause I demand it
Chief headbuster, throw a ace, come back on the sixth
Gotta jump, yeah, I ran but came back with the fifth
We turn May to the 4th of July
Sober you up, you're high
(?) I'm the voice of the (?)

(VERSE 5: Starang Wondah)
Yo, it's Starang Won with no deal, I'm mobile
This rap shit is so real, man, you don't even know Will
I play the crib, re-runs of _Moesha_
Eatin cold pizza, man, smokin' more reefer
Passed my bitch up, took the hooker back, it's cheaper to keep her
Try to escape, a nigga keep gettin' in deeper
Yo, this ain't the same Starang niggas is used to
I'm neutral but that don't mean a nigga won't shoot you
Yo, I write a check, niggas turn up dead
I'm like a toaster the way a nigga burn up bread
Aha, I come on, I play chess when I'm rappin'
For real yo, a nigga feel like I'm the best when I'm rappin'

(VERSE 6: Steele)
General Steele, original head, original crook
Reside in Southside Queens, born in the Brook
As a youth I was raised up by the books
Mom and pops gave what they could, the rest I took
Crook put me on, told me, ""God, step to your biz
The hood needs soldiers to represent for the kids
Boom Camp started, so y'all gotta finish the shit""
BC legendary, dog, remember these kids
No record company can put an end to this shit
We click-click-click-connect, stay connect to get bricks
Black Smif-n-Wessun's the shit, we puttin' it in
Entered da Stage underaged and became men
I shine, you shine, get your papers, mang
These cold streets preach the Rude Awakening
For the People we gon' do this, we endurin the pain
Duck Down more than a label, this family, mang

225,"Haunted nights for halcyon days
Can't sleep to the scraping of his voice
Nature's way struck grief in me
And I became a ghost in sickness

Willingly guided into heresy
Beneath the surface, stark emptiness
And you'd pity my conviction
Whereas I thought of myself as a leader

You'd cling to your pleasant hope
It is twisted fascination
While I'd ruin the obstacles into despair
And I'm praising death

Lost love of the heart
In a holocaust scene memory

Decrepit body wearing transparent skin
Inside, the smoke of failure

Wept for solace and submit to faith
In his shadow I'm choking
Yet flourishing

Master

A delusion made me stronger
Yet I'm draped in pale withering flesh
I sacrificed more than I had
And left my woes beneath the mire

228,"Beware of what's around you.
The elements of life will sometimes take you in.
Bad things always surround you.
It's your choice now to think.
Crime is easy to come by and temptation is bound to bring you down.
Corruption distorts your judgement and it seems you can't trust no one now.
Thinking to myself there's a price to pay.
Is it worth the pain,
The pain of someone taking your life away?
Saying to myself there is a better way.
It's not worth the pain,
The pain of someone taking it all away.
Memories are here to remind you,
Learn from your brothers.
Don't make their mistakes.
Trouble will somehow find you,
It's your choice to contemplate.
Crime don't pay in the long run.
Money ain't worth the risk of death or jail.
I'm not judging no one.
I'm just thinking, talkin' to myself.

And how will you be when rain clouds come?
And pull you down again
How will you feel when there's no one?

Turning to face what you've become
Buried the ashes of someone
Broken by the strain
Trying to fill that space inside

I'll never leave you dry

Carry the motion back to me, to me

Knocking hands together well
Raise a city; build a living hell
Join the race to suicide

In the black, the wings deliver him

And a headache the size of your little white lies

Place my head between my hood and the vent
Walk home from the station
No friends

Killing time by killing myself slowly
Drugs and booze and tobacco companies own me
You said you never meant any harm
But you meant what you did
Now I'm hurt and you're alarmed
I'm a replaceable fixture in your house
I'm a dispensable character from your past
And I'm not feeling safe, come on pick up the fucking phone

I need some'ing jazzy, sophisticated X-rated
Freaky and dedicated, highly anticipated I'm just so thugged out
I'm living life, as a G
Hit the pad and turn it up, and try to smoke a QP
Watch them space age broads, 'cause they think they slick
Get to running they mouth quick, trying to catch 'em a trick
I like 'em super-duper fine, with they g-string tight
Couple squares of flight, and she gon work it all night
This the pimp zone, where niggaz get lynched on
And all that chatter just don't matter, 'cause I've been gone
I'm trying to get high mayn, you know I gotta stay lit
Full of that sticky-icky shit, that them white boys get
You can catch me on the highway, cause it ain't no joke
Me manish and Appy Scappy, in a cloud of smoke

Where my dogs at, and where you cats at
We roll it up and twist it fat, because it's like that
We get our smoke on, keep some'ing to choke on
We hit the club and get a broad, and then get straight gone

I get my blaze on, as I'm playing for competition
Smother the opposition, till I'm done with the mission
I stay fired up, to keep the stress off my mind
Hustling and making runs, trying to dodge doing time
My lifestyle, consists of dirt and bad habits
Murder money and tragic, killer weed and magic
This a different page, I'm tal'n bout really in a rage
Fuck minimum wage, getting twenty for the stage
On a paper hunt, getting gritty for mo'
Six figgas is all right, but it be coming too slow
I put my soldier rag out, when my times gets tough
I gotta stay with some'ing to puff, because this world is rough
So get your groove on, then try to move on
And let 'em know that you for real, and you gon come strong
Go on rock it go on drop it, girl that's all on you
I call the shots on this track, like a real pimp do
So save the drama for you mama, or you riding or not
'Cause if you ain't that lil' mess, then go take your spot

Say you hot girl, I saw you peeping from afar
Let me see you do your thang, in the presence of a star
She don't give a damn, she just wanna bite the bar
Strip and skinny dip, up in the bubble bath spa
Smoke on light green rolled up, out the jar
Jump in the king sizes, take a thug to war
I'm on cruise control, for the rest of the night
Just a mack of all trades, with his shit locked tight
Where my dogs at, they got this motherfucker jumping
Where my hogs at, 'cause we ain't got time for the bumping
Independent black owned, standing tall and strong
Got bout five or six cars, two or three cell phones
This is mob status, 'cause we some young tycoons
Trying to have mo' money, than silver spoons what

Keep on smiling
Don't lose faith and don't lose heart
When you're crying
Just keep trying to remind yourself you're a shining star
Yes you are

When the angels look at you... what will you say?
They've got a way of knowing who qualifies
Just let 'em see that light in your eyes

Keep on shining
Keep on smiling
Don't lose faith and don't lose heart

Always look so sad
I don't know why
How can they be so still and moving

Let the lighting flash
Let the rain pour down
Turn me inside out
Turn me all around
You can tear my heart
You can tear me down
Leave me something more than empty

So I asked the Raven as he passed by
I said tell me Raven, how'd you make the sky
I took the moon and stars and threw them high
I need someplace to be flying

So take good care
Of what's left of my love
See there's more than justice up above
Gave you my heart, it wasn't enough

I talk to myself (myself), when there is no one to talk to

(Tiffany)
Ever wonder just what it's like talkin' to yourself every night?
Will I ever make it through the day?

(Krayzie)
It's so hard to believe that I'm still living, I'm alive
My clock is still ticking, guessing that God is still with me (with me)
'Cause I could have been gone so many times before
Murda Mo is chasing me I'm bearly escaping it
My instincts is tellin' me that I might not live long in my life (my life)
My life is a jungle I really don't love it it's really to crumble
I fight with these devils on daily basis
And I try to stay humble
Try not to fall, but what if I slip, trip?
Try to stay calm, but what if I flip?
Kill 'em all
Last night I had a long talk with myself (myself)
Drama had a nigga wondering, wondering how close am I to hell
Then I had to pray can't let them brake me, awww nah, awww nah
But it's everyday they try to make me soft
But so fried, so high is my mistake
Don't worry when I'm in the clouds
Well that's how I stay (stay)

(Chorus: Tiffany)
Ever wonder just what it's like talkin' to yourself every night?
Will I ever make it through the day?
Never thought I make it this far
Kinda wonder just where you are?
Will you ever make it through the day?

(Krayzie)
Caught up in my complications nowhere to go
It's mandatory that I face them, even though I don't want to
They say karma can murda ya, murda ya
All this drama just got me nervous
'Cause I know I've popped shots that don't stop
They don't stop
Soon as I lose it they know I get stupid

I was told what it means to be a man
And now I've reached that age
I've tried to do all those things the best I can
No matter how I try
I find my way to the same old jam

Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown-eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

Sixteen, I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be
It only took a couple of days till she was rid of me
She swore that she would be all mine and love me till the end
But when I whispered in her ear, I lost another friend, oh

Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown-eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown-eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

I know what it means to be alone
I sure do wish I was at home
I don't care what the neighbors say
I'm gonna love you each and every day

You can feel the beat within my heart
Realize, sweet babe, we ain't never gonna part
I feel good when I look into your eyes.

I'm dressed in black, high heels, black veil, and a strap
Homies sheddin tears about it, reminscin
Older yesteryears, how we kicked it there

A hundred percent of you think you're popular
I haven't watched cable and television, in 20 years
You catch the hook
I don't even know how the average jackass with a jersey look
Check the format, Mr. and Mrs. Unknown
I'm like the Amish people
Candles, no phone, although jocked by many stars
Who copy me, still on my bone - been ridin' limos
Watching crossing guards move you to the Immature zone
From top to middle, down to the bottom
You face the highway, lookin' at Leatherface
Three miles away, you'll be in wrong place
I will make the move with the truck
The Funeral Director, will come with his own
Black suit and that spector, to step in his ride
Will we see, when the cow walks at night midnight with the leather hide
I will walk and stand in the dark zone, with the light, from the lamp
This is no sleepaway camp

That's right, I am, the Funeral Director
And we do not, run, a sleepaway camp here

Manic depressive, mental patient
In a basement smokin' wet in the morgue
With a swordfight, cat up, runnin' meditatin
Without no ouiji board
My omnipotent potential crush skulls
Chewin through yo' favorite rapper's nails
Walkin' with body parts in L-A-X airport
With a briefcase kept confidential
A natural born menace runnin' loose through yo' neighborhood residential
Urban suburban section a killin' machine, with 187 credentials
My bladin through South Central, South Bronx, walkin' through South Chicago
Ivan Durago, Red Dragon, Hannibal Canibal, chewin through human jawbones
Handle your mandible with a iron claw, black iron eagle with evil thoughts
I release human form, drink blood drops
Love to watch when a body drops, when the shotty pops, better drop
When I strike yo' turf, 'cause if you don't run and hide, it's suicide
I'ma stun yo' hide, and leave you - six feet underneath the earth
Serial killer like Ted Bundy, on the mic I'm Adolf Hitler
Far worse than Osama Bin Laden, plottin on hell
When I get there I'ma kill the devil first, then put his head up for sale
Put his head out for sale, put his head up for sale

Yes, we will, put his head up for sale

Too small for the eye to see
Dare you take a peek inside it

Things my dad couldn't explain
And things that others kept from me

It could be places you've not been
Or something of which you're ashamed
Sometime when you took the credit
Another when you look the blame

But I'ma let you know now
Blackout, it's gettin' dark in here

Turn on the light, let me see what's in front of me
All of a sudden, this picture I painted just turned ugly
I'm tryin' to do good, but the devil's fuckin' with me
'Cause I ain't ever had no beef, but now I need some fuckin' heat
It seems like every time I get it I lose it
Get it, abuse it, and what I'm left with is useless
'Cause three years in a row, I felt like the world was mine
And three years in a row, I lost it all in the blink of an eye
And I believe what I do'll come back one day
But why am I still losin'? I can't take the pain
Am I to blame? Please excuse me for my rotten ways
I'm just tryin' to do what I gots to do so I get paid
Get down and pray to the souls from up above

Forgive me for my sins and all the shit that I did

Only feelin' in this world is the life within you
You'd have to be damn near dead to see the nights I been through
Damn near dead to feel the wind beneath you
Envisionin' so much, my minds an open window
Where I gather all these thoughts for all your broken info
If seein' is believin', then there's more to live fo'
My only reasonin' is breathin' and I live to just hope
What you know about bein' bedside next to your girl
On poison control IV's 'cause she can't stand the world?
And what you know about no heat and no electric?
I sold my MP to pay the bills, I'm so pathetic
I wake up and go to work, back aches and my shoulders hurt
And what's it worth? I'm easily checked and don't control my earth
Still walk these hollow grounds, bein' lost but never found
Say to the Lord, ""I'll die for music"", but there's never sound
Screamin' in vein, everything be seemin' the same
Ask my mom, ""What's the problem, why am I feelin' this way?""
Ask my pop, ""Can you solve it?"", this game, I'm bleedin' to stay
More then willing to give it up if I can't live it up
Hand in my clutch, gun in my lap
Doin' a buck and some change, not knowin' where the fuck I'm at

Forty-six years old, middle of his life
My mother ain't have a job, poppy was on his grind
And we ain't got no money, so she lose her fuckin' mind
Lenny helped out, and that was real
But he had a little daughter to raise, and that's the deal
My other brother, I won't mention his fuckin' name
'Cause he ain't worthy of my bitterness or fuckin' pain
Me and my mother, all we needed was some love
And my brother, all he needed was his drugs
How could you look at us with a job, we was poor
It's your mother birthday, you don't give her a call?
You have two nephews and a beautiful niece

But my kids need socks and shoes, I'm walking through

Don't you know on the streets I woulda- nevermind

Spot popping off until the police rushed us
Handcuffed us, I thought I was gone
Coulda cried, thinking I'd miss my son being born

257,"We see you standing on the highway waiting for the attention you don't deserve.
Paint me a gun my love.
Pull the trigger on me, baby.
Blow me away.

Why didn't you take your photographs with you?
Look at everyone else you're killing with you.
She sidewalks through the rain.
There's a pulse but not even a murderous photograph.
Think about being the hero, think about being the legend.
Another one that went and forgot to return.
Dining at a table for two, forget the expenses.
Pack your tears in a suitcase and run away with my heart.
I don't ever want to wake up.
That bottle is no good anymore.
It's shattered.
Forgive me.
I'd like to fade away, wipe me from your diary.
I bet you felt so alive.
'But the ghost of me, it needs to die.'
Well, I'm not trying to stop you sir.
It's just that we need everyone here accounted for.

259,"It's a common theme. The world is monotone and mean
It's grown into a full-blown bag of bones that holds reserves of self-esteem
And it's worse to melt a dream away with nothing there to replace it with
Smashed hopes never heal and when it peels away, his faith is stripped
The paces trip the walk and talk is cheap but still in stock
Public outrage screams for justice, looting shops and killing cops
The wheels can't stop because it's downhill and the music's up to loud
Fingers plug their ears, now shouts rang out and reason's not allowed
Believers got to proud 'cause we held the magic backstage passes
Now they act like fascists, blocking all the gates to heavenly access
And that's just when the package has no doorstep left to land on
Blacklisted seekers wander wondering what it means to be transformed
They can't see because the pastor's lingo wasn't made for their people
White-collar congregation makes contributions to his ego
And it's evil and it hurts and it tears us all apart
And I swear a man can blind you with the blackness in his heart
The shattered parts of speech are hard to reach in times of need
The cuts are deep, but I can't bleed unless I think it helps you see
I'll stand against oppression although they claim it sets me free
'Cause even when I'm speaking life I know that death is deaf to me...

Gather in together where the sky meets the basement
Gotta make the world a better place where you take it
Face to the sunrise, feet to the basement
Walk everybody, just walk, walk
Gather in together where the sky meets the basement
Gotta make the world a better place where you take it
Face to the sunrise, feet to the basement
Walk everybody just walk, walk...(Repeat)

Go for the uprise, huddled in the playground
Cuddle the women and kids. Tell 'em to stay down
Fellowship with anybody willing to work
Then sell a bit of land between heaven and Earth
Catalog the converts. Carry cross for the crippled
Bury every soul that falls anywhere inside the middle
Bang your head against the backdrop. Block out the bad thoughts
Cut out the trash talk, ready for the blast off
Bang your head against the backdrop. Block out the bad thoughts
Cut out the trash talk, ready for the blast off
Bang your head against the backdrop. Block out the bad thoughts
Cut out the trash talk, ready for the blast off...

I wanna be a better man. I wanna strip the flesh from spirit
I wanna write the songs that people sing that inspire them to be fearless
Never changing my appearance for moments edited and altered
Full of awkward things to say today for the lucky seventh caller
I've considered every offer on its merits before I refused it
And that's mainly on the basis of their generic brand of two-cents
If there's land beneath the cruise ship, then it's time to rock the boat
If your label is a nuisance, then it's time to let 'em go
If it's time for execution, make sure to protect your throat
If you're losing your grip, hold tight to the end of the rope
If you're broken or you're broke, take a breath and count your blessings slow
It's feast or famine. Sometimes you starve, sometimes you choke
Sometimes you think, sometimes you know
Sometimes you pay, sometimes you owe
Sometimes it burns a hole inside but you're too proud to let it show
Reap or sow, keep breathing slow because we need to know the difference
There's a time to walk on the sun, but there's a time to keep your distance...

261,"Up in tha morning and out to school, the teacher is teaching the golden rule
American history, practical math, studying hard hoping to pass, working your
Fingers right down to the bone, and the guy behind you won't live you alone,
""Ring ring"" goes the bell, their cooking the lunches ready to sell, you're
Lucky if you can find a seat, fortunate if you have time to eat, back in the
Class room open you're books, keep with the teacher you don't know how mean she
Looks as soon as 3:00 rolls around, you finally lay your burdon down, close up
Your books get out of your seat, down the halls and into the street, up to the
Corner around the bend, ride to the juke joint, you go in,

(Chorus) 2 times
Drop the coin right into the slot, you gotta hear something that's really
Hot, with the one you love, you'll make it romance, all day long you've been
Wanting to dance feelin' the music from head to toe, round and round and round we
Go


Hail, Hail rock 'n' roll, deliver me from these days of cold, long live rock n'
Roll, the beat of the drums loud and gold, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll, the
Feeling is there, body and soul

262,"At noon the wind comes through
Across the bay on a clear day
And I can watch the boats come in and set their anchors
And my folks are away at the store
So I don't have to listen to anyone say anything.
And I swim out as far as I can
And float on my back
Just waiting for nothing.
I hope they never come back to this house.
It's a lot more fun alone.
I can do anything I want
And so I'm swimming
More like floating
And I'll just stay out here
Until the night comes crashing down
And I swim out as far as I can
And float on my back
Just waiting for nothing.
They always come home
At the wrong time
Like when I'm all right
And don't need no one at all.

Oh, have you seen my love?

All that I want is to be your friend,
'Cause you're the only friend I've ever known
All I need is our love, we agreed
That the two of us wouldn't be alone

In these faded old photographs, you can see how we smiled
I became a man in your arms, now I'm helpless as a child

Have you seen my love?
Have you seen my love?
Have you seen my little girl?
Oh, have you seen my love?

There is a dream that we both used to share
And we swore we would never wake
Now the dream's a nightmare, and the truth to be fair
Is that dreaming was the first mistake

Though we share the same memories, and I swear that's her face
Did you bury the woman I love, and fall asleep in her space?

Have you seen my love?
Have you seen my love?
Have you seen my little girl?

Wing of wax, or wing of gold leaf
Choose one.
Float or plummet 20 thousand cold leagues
My nourishment's provided in the summer
So that I wonder
How y'all chasin' dreams when most tangibles still outruns ya
Hail dirty doll immaculate performance
Warm as the march of a billion torches forward to burn what I born at
Cut and paste alertness to current set is provided quick
Shimmy the pirate ship mast, spot the islands on the sovereign in her bow
Facing, let's salute the embrace pertinent generals who turned innocent hermits to burning spectacles.
Flirtin' with a serpent workin' overtime
Drain the battery, siphon the poison and flood his majesty's hatchery.
I was riding on the yellow bus to where the brush thickens.
Yeah, an it ain't exactly plush pickin's
I'd rather take the time to burn every last bridge I've ever crossed beneath the sun
Than live my life knowin' you may one day follow me over one.
Snake bite
Breath too heavy to hold.
Caught up in the wake of the red witch tryin' to swim it.
Ran for the sake of dead click stripped of idyllic image
Steal a sloppy earth meal feed my pottery wheel to model colossal vision
Thrill, shrunken with a bucket of pennies
I'ma drag my sneakers through the dirt like alligator bellies
'Til the cloud burst
Honor and a loud thirst submersed in a trap
Little drummer boy vs. thunderclap

In a city of garbage, tryin' to reap the harvest
Adaption is the trap in which the artist meets the forest
Swing your little axe or be an oak tree if you can
Either way, adapt to circumstance or play you final hand.

No enigma, an attempt to bury the hatchet
Rendered me victim of deviltry plus wounded like stigmatics
Somethin's somethin' hazardous
I smell an inch of difference in this mornin's pollution pistons and how the loose ends drift in
My sour patch institutions slipped in amidst the invaders and,
Pardon my tone but,
This garden's grown fuckin' acres since my visit.
Itchin' to count the layers in the blizzard to that chapter where my family inserts the dagger and
Twists it.
It's the carnival, have you any sweets for my weary kin
It's the carnival, have you any feed for my cheery grin
It's the carnival, welcome, play our games you'll never win
'Cause it's that carnival where every freak show spectacle's your friend.
An' I'm a,
Ghostly galleon, tossed upon cloudy seas
Antifreeze to glacier cookin' a look of fiery nature
It's the,
Ceilin' feelin' too heavy to bless the I-beams for a fraction more collapse (I left sorry) that to
Your door.
Bitchin' my back to hell's kitchen, back
Burnin' murder machinery, released regardless of the pardons
Hitchin my life to the leash of one minstrel
Sick of same window different visual
Same agnostic hostage different ritual
Play, cooperative supercolony clash (I heard we have a dust collection - let me see it)
Ooh, I duel this underdog verse forced adaption to the marbles of the now
Since then my knuckles haven't once dragged on the ground.

In a city of garbage, tryin' to reap the harvest
Adaption is the trap in which the artist meets the forest
Swing your little axe or be an oak tree if you can
Either way, adapt to circumstance or play you final hand.

Settling the foundation of an infernal
Dimension of wrath
A revelation strikes with new awareness
Upon the masses
Veil of darkness unravel, a horrific sphere unfolds

An altering of the senses - to discover
What is behing light, beyond celestial slavery
Entangles the mind in dark waves, fiery &amp; monotonous
Deep is the well of dark mystery

The enlightenment of madness presents itself
On the soil above a lower world
In everlasting ebony shades of the damned
Choirs of madness chant in agony, as blood
Flows furiously (through my veins)

Blurred visions through a smoke-filled sky
With fists clenched, I gaze on through the ugly
The only right path

The surge of deconstruction casts light aside
The summoning at last
Deceiver, pioneer of this insight
Consume what is of joy

Consume what is of joy!

And enless rage until we dance on the
Hypocrites' grave
Step on the crucifix
Ans speak the tongue of blasphemy

The shivery
Crawling, freezing through the innards &amp; up the spine
The separating of this shell of flesh
&amp; A dark spirituality
Do I believe?
It believes in me

Of footsteps on the pavement of our lives

One trick is all that horse can do
He does, one trick only
It's the principal source of his revenue
But when he steps into the spotlight
You can feel the heat of his heart
Come rising through

See how he dances
See how he loops from side to side
See how he prances
The way his hooves just seem to glide
He's just a one-trick pony, that's all he is,
But he turn that trick with pride

He makes it
Look so easy, it looks so clean
He moves like God's immaculate machine
He makes me
Think about, all these extra moves I've made
And all this herky-jerky motion
And the bag of tricks it takes
To get me through my working day
One-trick pony

He's a one-trick pony
He either fails or he succeeds
He gives his, testimony
Then he relaxes in the weeds
He's got one trick to last a lifetime

Yeah, that's all he needs

Di tappeti stesi, di tende e di silenzi
Di casbah e di mercati
Di aeroplani su terre straniere
E di piedi scalzi nei vicoli di Algeri

Hai il profumo dolce dell'erba e dell'incenso
Di bracieri accesi che brillano d'inverno
Di ebano e di spezie
Di sabbia portata dal vento
E di palme cresciute alla luce dell'Oriente

La tua voce parla di caldo e di colori
Di mattoni gialli asciugati sotto il sole
Di strade e carovane
Di villaggi ai confini del mondo
Di esuli stanchi che aspettano il ritorno

That ends in misery
A tale of sex and sin and greed
I'm in this prison of my own insanity
And there's no one I can blame but me
Tossed between the wreckage
And washed up on the shore
I swear I can't believe my eyes
Could I be mistaken
Am I really here
Have I found my paradise
The streets are paved in diamond
The wall are painted gold
And everybody knows my name
The girls are always gorgeous
And the drinks are always cold
I know I'll never be the same
I swear we'll live forever
And we'll never have to cry
Because no one here could ever die
The sun it sets like fire
Stare into your eyes
I'll never make it out alive
Turquoise water
Connect me to the shore
Of a land, a life left far behind
And I've got the memories burning deep inside
I'll try to black them from my mind
A land of plenty
A land made just for me
Where I can't help but feel at home
Until a man of darkness
A story he a told
Of the only treasure I was yet to hold
I stood before the people
And demanded more, darkness
Where sinners come to die
Leaving Eden far behind

Fear is real, a disease
And hold myself against my knees
And if you lose your mind
Call the sun, then unwind
There's too much to leave behind

Life's on remote control. Got to...

It's time to bring it down, don't front on the sound
Check your thunderpound, it be Skillz blowing up from the underground
Now, don't waste your time and try to taste mine
I'm killing MC's and going low-key like baselines
Be hesitant, VA residents ain't friendly
Diss and I'll walk on your back like Mr. Benny
When my shit drop, all this wack shit'll stop
Till Janet stops, rockin' Planet Rock
Keepin' it real hot
I specialize in microphone satisfaction
Hackin' MC's who think Skillz be relaxin'
Straight from punchline ave, metaphor metropolis
I'm shockin' MC's like seeing their grandmothers topless
Watch this, check for my sequal
I make raps and niggas vanish like the Village People
Hey, you checkin' for me check &#24966;ound my way
They say Skillz don't play when he's representin' VA

Chorus 4x: [Mad Skillz]
Virginia's in the house [I said it]
V-A [so what you gotta say?]

Verse two: Mad Skillz

Yo, niggas get pissed, MC's cease to exist
As I persist, to drill mics and fill glock clips
Don't sleep, like Mobb Deep, I'm leaving brothers shook
While you debatin' I'm urinatin' on your rap book
I be Skillz see, the ill East Coast MC
All my peeps down in VA, this one's for you B
So don't give me nothin' I'm takin' my props
And I ain't stoppin' till my face is on the side of a lunchbox
The wack fold, &#24950;ause they been told
Their rhymes used to be worth something like Mr. T's gold
Now I'm in, so watch me Kline like Calvin
I'm the Dread Man, you fucked up by lettin' me make an album (huh)
The outcome is ill, when I grip the steel
Don't be mad at me (why?), if you ain't got no skill
No questions, no second guessin' without a doubt
Niggas know my name and they know who's in the house

Verse three: Mad Skillz

Is VA up in here? (HELL Yeah!)
Then here's a jam for you to spread across the state like welfare
I'm a special dread, that still be tactics
Doing MC's anytime, anyplace like Janet Jackson
It ain't about dirt roads and corn bread
Niggas be MC'ing, G'ing, war deeds and dread
After this pack it up, I'll tell you my plan
I'm on a VA tour with Kalonji my man
Check it, hittin' city to city like a horny trucker
This year, it's East Coast like a motherfucker
Misconceptions are coming back like reflections
Niggas who dissed, are now checkin' for my section
They wanna be down, they makes me laugh
That's like Brandy gettin' dropped and then you askin' for her autograph
You know the steelo and Skillz be in ya

Suck it dry. Do or do not, there is no try.
Do what they say, the elite will never pay.
You jump how high they say.

Believe what you see with your own eyes.
In the flesh it will be, not televised.
I know you want something.
The puppets speak with the master's mind.

If I never see you again, it'll be too soon.
No beginning no end, don't let the fool rule.

Mark the sky. Rage intensified.
Impressive, most impressive.
Fight, fight!

Release what you feel on the inside.
No more honesty in this world of lies.
I know you want something. We all want something.
No one speaks for me. No one speaks my mind.

If I never see you again, it'll be too soon.
No beginning no end, don't let the fool rule.

Album: Rip the Jacker
Song: M-Sea-Cresy
Producer: Stoupe
Time: 3:50

(Canibus)
Out of the Umbilicus Mundi,
This is lyrical lunacy from a human being to speak so fluently,
Bars of poetry without precedence, complete par excellence,
Listen to the 'Levitibus' testament,
To understand me you need help,
You've got to see the film 'The Day After Trinity' written by Jon Else,
To understand that, you must know thyself,
You should keep listening 'cause Canibus' flow might help

(Canibus)
To find the answers that we didn't know,
Maybe Edgar Allen Poe's description of El Dorado is not so,
See, the reason there's no light at the end of the tunnel,
Is 'cause we're really not in a tunnel we're trapped in a bubble,
The government hierarchy and the dregs of society,
Can you explain why you believe Hell is fiery?
We're suffering from symptoms of drapetomania,
Slavery isn't over it just took a new alias,
The Data Repository establishment and maintenance,
Almost turned me into an atheist scared of aliens,
Why write lyrics when I can make a better living,
Selling freeze-dried venom to wildlife clinics,
'Cause I hate the thought of being a predictable bore,
Once you get used to me you won't love me no more,
The 'Final Soliloquy of the Internal Paramour',
What are we all to do when rap music is gone?
I hope ""God and the imagination are one"",
A golden tongue, can achieve synchronicity with the Sun,
Transcended beyond the flesh and the blood, 'cause this is level one, 
After this album my message is done

(Canibus)
But you can't battle me, so you'd rather embarrass me,
I maintain dignity in the face of calamity,
They reach out their hand to me and talk dishonestly,
But I read through their syntactic structure like Noam Chomsky,
A student so overzealous I motivate my trainers,
I'd rather get some now than get some later,
Take a break from writing rhymes on paper, recondition my character,
Change my nature with seven days of Vipassana,
Let go of the stress, man I was deeply depressed,
So famished, in fact, I needed a rest,
To regenerate my mind, 
Bless the cornerstone of my rhyme with corn, oil and wine, 
Then see the light in a luminous paradigm,
It became more apparent with time,
All I had to do was follow the signs,
To be a better man I need help,
I've just got to find the link between my inner deity and myself

286,"Figured it out before I'm a teen, humming along the washing machine
Making some faces I made a scene, no one around to see how green
Run away, run away scream
I saddle my thoughts for the big machine
That is why that's the way we watch the movies
In some silly way life begins to change
That's the way we watch the movies
In some silly way life begins to change for you
You're old enough
Life begins to change
Lift up my fork and celebrate ease
Liquid enough, liquid it seems
Walking on pillows I learn how to sleep
Somehow I feel what flies seem to breathe
Run away, run away dream
I like all the flights on the big machine
That is why that's the way we watch the movies
In some silly way life begins to change
That's the way we watch the movies
In some silly way life begins to change for you
You're old enough
Life begins to break
Come on out. I've got a secret
Time will let you in
And if you want you can have a secret
Time will let you through
Come on out
You've gotta see it
Time to let you in
And if you want you can ride with me
If the wind is right the wind is free
I knew it then
I knew it well
Like a pilot diving down wishing well,
I know it's better when the weather changes your hair
Fifteen paces a mile an hour, it's gotta feel good
Sucking a slurpee for ultimate power, it's gotta feel good
Fighting, you're back when you feel like a coward
It's gotta feel good
And everything's moving at the ultimate speed
Believe it
That's the way we watch the movies
In some silly way life begins to change
You're older now

Little things said have said enough
I should have shot myself on the run

I want love love love
I want love love love right now
I want love love love
I want love love love right now so come on

She comes back from the winter
Looking straight into my eyes
Now I'm standing like a lunatic

Here I am deep in my soul
Here I am walkin' on the sand
Talkin' to a man in a language that neither he or I understands
Felt painless, though I'm anxious to ask him what his name is
His clothes looked the ancient and his face was ageless
His hand were sacred as if travelled through places
And I was an Atheist until I was greeted by the warm embraces of the local natives
Now I'm in the middle of an oasis singin' praises to a gigantic spaceship
Walkin' in the middle of a desert, I felt pleasant
While Kings and Queens and men with wings stand in my presence
In their pure essence, now take me to where my ancestors are restin
They begin to take me by my hands and walked on the sands
To the deep wilderness behind the villages
I looked up; we went to a mystic spot
He said, ""Here it is, there's the pyramids where your spirit lives""
I walked inside, seen myself as King Tut, layin in a green tux
Wings came out in dusk
I saw mummies moon walking out of their coffins
Then a voice said, ""Well done""
Then they greeted me in welcome
The Places Where Pharaohs Go
Places Where Pharaohs Go
Places Where Pharaohs Go
Which word best describes this urge?

It moves clockwork, times stopped but I'm not disturbed

So bring in bodybags when I start bangin'

Give up what you got, or get your ass shut the fuck up
Run 'em down and gun 'em down yeah that's how we do it
Niggaz get killed, and then filled with embalmin fluid
Step to the niggaz that I'm checkin'
Pull out the tec and I reckon you'll get murdered in a second
Bang with the nine, boom with the pow
Motherfuckers are fallin' and crawlin on the ground
Snitches get stitches, bitches that act snotty
Inside the parties even the hotties get turned to bodies
Now I heard, they got other places that's similar
But I represent, New York you fuck around I'm killin' ya
A whole block of cops patrollin when I'm rollin'
And if my pockets are swollen you know somebody sick I've stolen
Yeah you niggaz get ripped, when my clip, goes in the

And like I said before, it's the motherfuckin problem solver

Yeah... yeah, Priesthood
Uh, Get Large Productions
Revisited, son, yo, self destruction

(Chorus 2X: Killah Priest)
Look at my life, Brooklyn's my wife
Close that it's tight, in the bullpens I write, so/yo

(Killah Priest)
They say Heavy Mental is a classic
My pen'll draw graphic, backwards, thinking
Drinkin', the ink pen rap kid
Clap y'all rappers to the point of extinction
Relax and listen, the flow is like hydro
And hell is slow, puffin' out your nose
Creatin' fogs of old school flicks, I do this for kids
My music, my gift, broken ghettos and harsh reality
Made me thorough, my art gallery, nine uncles
I flunked school, robbin', rope chains, the street have no name
Fiends that preach the dope game
Deep like the blood of my nephew, soaked in the streets
I heard it scream through the concrete, rest in peace
This last release, the flesh that eat, want me
The pen comes to me, I open my books, like scrolls of Moses
I look, I see skulls and ghosts
I shook, the Bible, I wrote it with hooks, come on

(Killah Priest)
The pen, the pad, the friends I had
To the live it ends in vag', it's like grin to a laugh
To wild outrageous, and then I'm mad
To a face that show expression, depression, begin to look sad
The tears come out, it's weird, I dumb out, pretend to be glad
Cigarette on my lips, I don't even smoke
I leave that to Kruger, I gotta stay afloat
Watch the way we maneuver
Peace to Tutta, held me down in Cali
I see the future, flee from troopers
Revolutionary blood, sweat and tears, obsessin' with fears
Paranoia, got me needing more lawyers
Got me reachin' for guns, see I'm comin' for ya
Hold up, I stargaze, into God's face
Embrace Allah's grace, sun and moon, star gates
Space, is my place of birth, made my way into the Earth
Came to the lunars of kings, held coins with wings, come on

(Killah Priest)
I gave y'all, all of my Views of Masada, the drama
Here's the clue, Proverbs, Priesthood, dons like Clint Eastwood
Black August, join the shortage
A rap athormesis, but that got restarted
So I Revisit y'all, with more of the God, that roar in they heart
Yo, Priest, you still hustle, Priest, you still struggle
Priest, you still bubble, them streets is still trouble
Them thieves will cuff you, lock you up in pens with men
That couple, friends will cut you
Poor education, the ghetto is hell
Heaven is Park Ave., the system is jail, religion wears a dark mask
Worn by faces, wind up in newspapers
A true gangsta, till the wheels fall off and the gats is on E
Two gats is on me
I kick open the door, take the whole pieces of war
Like Larry Davis, fuck this world, I break out y'all cages

Wake every brain
Three steps to Heaven

I have met the riot grrls who print their 'zines

Hiding for something they call home
Hoping to find some peace of mind
Sometimes we need to walk alone

She is set on running away
Though her mom was yelling she must stay
A wind beaten bird for reasons unheard
Sometimes it is best to run away

So fly away, fly away, fly away
Don't be afraid, don't hesitate, fly away

Some wear their bruises on their skin
Others hide their scars deep within
She has a wound close to her womb
Blames herself for letting it in

So fly away, fly away, fly away
Don't be afraid, don't hesitate, fly away

But she's afraid, she's afraid, she's afraid
Anyway
See those eyes, see those eyes, see those eyes
Hate and lies, a fire that slowly dies
But she will fly, she will fly, she will fly
Before it dies

Sometimes the hands that feed
Must feed a mind with a sick need
And the hands that clutch can be
The same hands that touch too much
Eyes that hungrily stare
Read in an access that's not there
While eyes close to hide tears
Or look away in fear
Run away

Passing the open stores
Hiding her dirty sores
Seeking asylum among freaks and whores
What wouldn't she give to be
In a society
Not learning the eyes to be closed but to see

Now she bites the words (Never)
She kicks the ground (Never)
Swallows her tears (Never will I go back)
She hits the walls (Leave me)
Scratches herself (Leave me)
Begs to all Gods (Rip me from this sick flesh)

(I will always be there)
No, she holds her ears
(You know that I love you)
Pretends that she doesn't hear
(We're in this together)
(We share the same skin)
Panic in his voice now
Free us from sin

(Tell me that you love me) This is the end
(I know that you do) Of her way
(Never ever again) Follow me down

(God forgive this hunger) Please mommy see
(Never tell a soul) Is it me

The sad-glad paymasters (for what it's worth).

There's a golden handshake hanging 'round your neck,
As you light your cigarette on the burning deck.

And you balance your world on the tip of your nose
Like a sealion with a ball, at the carnival.

You wear a shiny skin and a funny hat
The almighty animal trainer lets it go at that.
You bark ever-so-slightly at the trainer's gun,
With you whiskers melting in the noon-day sun.

You flip and you flop under the big white top
Where the long-legged ring-mistress starts and stops.
But you know, after all, the act is wearing thin
As the crowd grows uneasy and the boos begin.

But you balance your world on the tip of your nose
You're a sealion with a ball at the carnival.

Just a trace of pride upon our fixed grins
For there is no business like the show we're in.
There is no reason, no rhyme, no right
To leave the circus 'til we've said good-night.

The same performance, in the same old way;
It's the same old story to this passion play.
So we'll shoot the moon, and hope to call the tune
And make no pin cushion of this big balloon.

315,"[KRS] Yeah that's the one -- yo Thor-El just just check your mic

Verse One: Thor-El

So you wanna be the million dollar man, kid what's your plan
Make a deal with the devil settle for a hundred grand
Not enough I call your bluff, hit you with the stuff
Deal with this and think you're tough, gimme a call when things get rough
You get no Vette and, if I could stay leaded
I'm leavin' rappers one-legged from fakin like the prosthetic
You're artificial by cripple, rap is like your pistol
Grim Reaper, I got the whistle, death I pull no tissue
Hit you, like the Mac-11, MC's subtract by seven
Callin callin for the reverend, lookin' at hell like heaven
I'm on the map, makin' it like the crazy on the track
Oh what the hell I get my mail while I raid you till it crack

Chorus: KRS and Thor-El

H, I, P, H, O, P, we are
H, I, P, H, O, P, we are

Verse Two: KRS-One

C'mon, uh
Dead two in the head before some A&amp;R tell me
I must give up the streets you lift the company can sell me
What's the sense in being large if you can't take a risk?
Thinkin' a risk upon a disc means you&#25262;e written off the list
I'm not sayin' you can't have your fame and glory just don't bore me
When I come to see you live, and I paid twenty-five
That's, crazy loot Kris is saying I don't play those games
Killing Rhyme Sessions is the meaning of my name
But don't call my name in vain, 'cause I will appear
And your livest MC will get slain right here
See I do the homework, and I do the extra credit
You could sell a million records, and still can't set it
Cause the Lex or Beem is probably just the matches and a Jeep so
I'm sure your rap career now if they come before your people
Oh Lord! You can't be thinkin' about Billboard
With the mic cord, and several thousand people just bored
Being dope live is like being insured for life
You always get called back twice, you are

Verse Three: Thor-El, KRS-One

I burn like hy-dra-cho-loric and my city got itty
He's terrible, Thor-El's incredible and terrific
Is it, that you're under the influence of local obvious
Rappers that die, but why, explain the obvious

No stoppin' this lyrics from the esophagus
Rockin' strictly the hip-hop populace

Never be the proof but then it all came true
Wrote it in a letter that I sent to you

Maybe I'm a fool for believing you

So many people root for me

There's gonna be some action
It's time to have some fun

Kick out the lead and not be left to wait
Getting ready for the shaking up
I'm playing game with heart and soul
On the way that's the only way to go
Let's get it on, 'cause it's showtime

I'm here to be dreams come true
Where the crowds screams so loud
You'll never know how good it feels
It keeps me going strong

I always run like hell
To serve my every need
I always believe in myself
There's nothing I can't do

Kick out the lead and not be left to wait

...Give it a sec for the pain to start
This wreck right here it ain't for the faint of heart
They thought they saw the worst verse
From the team of G men who seem like nerds at first
Once they get to know us people dig us
Leaders in the fight for equal rights for niggaz
Inventor of the more demented flow nobody doubt it
This go for if ya 'bout it 'bout it or rowdy rowdy
Whatevers clever the master fold
Who every hooka heard a but now HO NO
If we see tomorrow the next day classes
The villain in the back with the x-ray glasses (*Pause*)
Have no fear the ninja here
Feel 'em like the tinge in ya ear from drinkin' ginger beer
When it's on loco head gon' lay low
And heat it like beef patty coco bread con queso
If you say so lace the whole case load
They say he wear a metal mask in case his face show
He told 'em they flows is bitch talk and ayo's
His whole crew walk with pitchfork and halo's
Say OH if you never worked a J-O
And keep more cash then a stash in a peso
Okay yo y'all know who to follow
Tie 'em up in the crib and leave the place hollow
...Oh shoot the goose she's loose
So wild you couldn't chase it down with straight fruit juice
Frown like the first time you taste cous cous
Stash the deuce deuce
Troops askin truce truce
Today on intense wreck week
We have the super villain in his own defense to speak
It's all part of my mental techniques
Available to freaks and pencil neck geeks
Train the same brain to a insane train of thought
On a campaign trail he came to gain ya support
Charge cash for a autograph
Say some shit to make ya daughta laugh
Then slaughta the ass
Seem 'em on the big screen like Steve McQueen
Do something and never be back once he leave the scene
Keep more medicated pads then Stridex
For his own sidewrecks with no known side effects
Before you press charges use ya noodle
So what when he grab the mic he scratch ya cute cuticles
Keep ya mouth shut everything'll be beautiful
It would be often rude to you now get back to ya hooty hoo
Damnit it ain't worth the drama can it
From the calm bandit eat rhymers like pomegranate
Soon as he stepped in he lit the room
Boom reschedule my noon with Britt Hume (Doom!)
In love with Mary Jane she's my main thing
Pulled her right from that webhead what a lame brain
Maintain say it don't spray it
Wanna see ya girl again ya might as well pay it
If I had a dime for every rhymer who bust guns
I'll have a cool mill for my sons in trust funds
When I was broker than a broke dick dog
I always kept a L to smoke in thick fog
When it rain it sure do thunderstorm
I got more rhymes in the summer than musty underarms
One two microphone checker
First learned to neck off a Home-Ec homewrecker
This is back when he was like crib age
When he hit the stage it's like a gauge to the rib cage
Break the mic like a rock star break a guitar
Jump off the stage like ""Yee haw!""

My blood again
For you this means
The end of all
Your sorrows

Your eternal life,
The end of your tears
And when the sunrise
Starts to appear,
You will be gone
When daylight dies,
Velvet night will be my guardian
To shelter my immortal soul

Death's souls: Erzebet sits close to her
She starts to lick her breasts
Then lust and blood
Begin to become one
With whispers of death

Countess: When lust and blood
Begin to become one
With whispers of death
Fire will burn her soul out

Ophelia: Lilith's daughter,
You can't steal my soul

Priest: She loves Satan... With whispers
Of death... She mentions his name

She enjoys the rippling of blood
And sings: Hail Satan

Knife in your hand 
With your back to the wall 
And those things in your mind 
They're out of control 

And your endless desire 
And your riddle on fire 
You take a step back 
And you walk away, you walk away 

And your down on your knees 
With your back to the wall 
And I wonder sometimes 
If you're there at all 
And you cry, and you try

I'm taking it easy if it comes to fate 
But for the time, I've gotta wait 

Soothe your bones
With the papers of a man that you know
His kids are really gonna grow
And leave their daddy home

But it's an easy game 
Those clouds bring heavy, heavy rain
And lifting is an awful lot of pain
We're gonna be sore for sure

How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?

And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneakin' out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times

I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in

It's hard to say it

Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down

We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we'd know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel

I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then

You can't replace it

I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it

I know the one thing that would never change

Sad wakes alone
Cradling the phone
Knows that sullen silence

I have no choice but to leave them to their own devices
I have come to understand one thing and one thing alone
One little piece of understanding
Glowing through this void of blankness and clean slates
Like a beacon of hope
Or just a reminder that I was always wrong:

Searching for yourself is like looking for the house you stand in
How could you possibly find it?
It's everywhere
It's all you know
And there are no other points of reference""

Instead of holding him tight they would rather watch him fall
But he knows and sometimes he weeps quietly his heart breaks and breaks
His fire seems to be extinct

Because the angel on my right ain't hanging out with me tonight

I got the car door opened up so you can jump in on the run
Your mom don't know that you were missing
She'd be pissed if she could see the parts of you that I've been kissing

Got your hand between my knees
And you control how fast we go by just how hard you wanna squeeze
It's hard to steer when you're breathing in my ear
But I got both hands on the wheel while you got both hands on my gears

By now, no doubt that we were heading south
I guess nobody ever taught her not to speak with a full mouth
'Cause this was it, like flicking on a switch

We were parked out by the tracks
We're sitting in the back
And we just started getting busy
When she whispered ""what was that?""
The wind, I think 'cause no one else knows where we are
And that was when she started screamin'
""That's my dad outside the car!""

Oh please, the keys, they're not in the ignition
Must have wound up on the floor while
We were switching our positions
I guess they knew that she was missing
As I tried to tell her dad it was her mouth that I was kissing

Hey, I knew this nigga named Johnnie Walker
A nightstalker, a big shit-talker
Even though he liked a lot of vodka (say what?)
He was from Tennessee, sprung off Hennessey
Makin' enemies fast - in L.A.N. they didn't play (what?)
He got into a Tanque/tangle with +Ray+, he had on too much gray
Ray had a Strawberry sister named Daquiri
Johnnie politely her ass behind the back three
Now, all four uncles E&amp;J wanna tossi
Martini and Rossi had to get the niggaz off me
He got jacked for his Dana's, in other words
(Give it up nigga, give it up!)
He caught the Nighttrain and blasted his Thunderbird
With the pistol, him and Cisco, couldn't stand him
'Cause he caught him lickin' Brandy off his sister named Kandi
At this point he had more bad luck than a trash truck
He lost his girl, Remi spent his last buck up
Remi caught him shootin game at Elayne, so now
Flowers and champagne don't mean a damn thang
Remi ended up runnin' off with Martin
He was wanted for arson for startin fires in Carson
So Johnnie hired a gun named Rum, and paid him
151 and the job got done
With a thirty-eight straight to the face
He caught him in a six-pack and got they ass back
Up close he made 'em post and broke all their glasses
(?) And Rum threatened their families with matches
He felt he needed more men just like Gin
So he packed his strap and started claimin Silver Satin
From then on in, anybody caught bailin
Down Seagram's 7 was bound to get sweated
Except Bartyles and James, 'cause they was cool
He knew 'em from school when they didn't bang and made moves
Turns out, he never reached the top
They found his ass at the beach ""on tha rox""

Du har slutit dina &#246;gonlocks kulisser
Och drar ner en dr&#246;mrid&#229;
I en bullerskyddad vr&#229;
Och f&#246;rsonar dej med hat och kompromisser

Men n&#228;r alla kastat masken och har b&#246;rjat hj&#228;lpas &#229;t

Och att du sen ska fatta att vi rott i samma b&#229;t

358,"<b>The Story Of The Hare Who Lost His Spectacles</b>
This is the story of the hare who lost his spectacles.

Owl loved to rest quietly whilst no one was watching.
Sitting on a fence one day, he was surprised when suddenly a kangaroo ran close by.
Now this may not seem strange, but when Owl overheard Kangaroo whisper to no one in particular,
""The hare has lost his spectacles,"" well, he began to wonder.

Presently, the moon appeared from behind a cloud and there, lying on the grass was hare.
In the stream that flowed by the grass a newt.
And sitting astride a twig of a bush a bee.
Ostensibly motionless, the hare was trembling with excitement,
For without his spectacles he appeared completely helpless.
Where were his spectacles? Could someone have stolen them?
Had he mislaid them? What was he to do?
Bee wanted to help, and thinking he had the answer began:
""You probably ate them thinking they were a carrot.""
""No!"" interrupted Owl, who was wise.
""I have good eye-sight, insight, and foresight.
How could an intelligent hare make such a silly mistake?""
But all this time, Owl had been sitting on the fence, scowling!
A Kangaroo were hopping mad at this sort of talk.
She thought herself far superior in intelligence to the others.
She was their leader, their guru. She had the answer:
""Hare, you must go in search of the optician.""
But then she realized that Hare was completely helpless without his spectacles.
And so, Kangaroo loudly proclaimed, ""I can't send Hare in search of anything!""
""You can guru, you can!"" shouted Newt.
""You can send him with Owl.""
But Owl had gone to sleep.
Newt knew too much to be stopped by so small a problem
""You can take him in your pouch.""
But alas, Hare was much too big to fit into Kangaroo's pouch.
All this time, it had been quite plain to hare that the others knew nothing about spectacles.

As for all their tempting ideas, well Hare didn't care.
The lost spectacles were his own affair.
And after all, Hare did have a spare a-pair.
A-pair.

<b>Forest Dance No.2</b>
Instrumental part

<b>The Foot Of Our Stairs</b>
We sleep by the ever-bright hole in the door,
Eat in the corner, talk to the floor,
Cheating the spiders who come to say ""Please"", (politely).
They bend at the knees.
Well, I'll go to the foot of our stairs.
Old gentlemen talk of when they were young
Of ladies lost, of erring sons.
Lace-covered dandies revel (with friends)
Pure as the truth, tied at both ends.
Well I'll go to the foot of our stairs.
Scented cathedral spire pointed down.
We pray for souls in Kentish Town.
A delicate hush
The gods, floating by
Wishing us well,
Pie in the sky.
God of Ages, Lord of Time,
Mine is the right, right to be wrong.
Well I'll go to the foot of our stairs.
Jack rabbit mister spawn a new breed of love-hungry pilgrims (no bodies to feed).
Show me a good man and I'll show you the door.
The last hymn is sung and the devil cries ""More.""

Well, I'm all for leaving and that being done,
I've put in a request to take up my turn
In that forsaken paradise that calls itself ""Hell""
Where no one has nothing and nothing is- well -meaning fool,
Pick up thy bed and rise up from your gloom smiling.
Give me your hate and do as the loving heathen do.

<b>Overseer Overture</b>
Colours I've none dark or light, red, white or blue.
Cold is my touch (freezing).

Summoned by name - I am the overseer over you.
Given this command to watch o'er our miserable sphere.
Fallen from grace, called on to bring sun or rain.
Occasional corn from my oversight grew.
Fell with mine angels from a far better place,
Offering services for the saving of face.
Now you're here, you may as well admire
All whom living has retired from the benign reconciliation.
Legends were born surrounding mysterious lights
Seen in the sky (flashing).
I just lit a fag then took my leave in the blink of an eye.
Passionate play join round the maypole in dance
(Primitive rite) (wrongly).
Summoned by name - I am the overseer over you.

<b>Flight From Lucifer</b>
Flee the icy Lucifer.
Oh he's an awful fellow!
What a mistake!
I didn't take a feather from his pillow.
Here's the everlasting rub: neither am I good nor bad.
I'd give up my halo for a horn and the horn for the hat I once had.
I'm only breathing.
There's life on my ceiling.
The flies there are sleeping quietly.
Twist my right arm in the dark. I would give two or three for
One of those days that never made impressions on the old score.
I would gladly be a dog barking up the wrong tree.
Everyone's saved we're in the grave.
See you there for afternoon tea.
Time for awaking the tea lady's making
A brew-up and baking new bread.

Pick me up at half past none
There's not a moment to lose.
There is the train on which I came.
On the platform are my old shoes.
Station master rings his bell.
Whistles blow and flags wave.
A little of what you fancy does you good (Or so it should).
I thank everybody for making me welcome.
I'd stay but my wings have just dropped off.

<b>10.08 To Paddington=</b>
Instrumental part

<b>Magus Perd&#233;</b>
Hail! Son of kings make the ever-dying sign
Cross your fingers in the sky
For those about to BE.
There am I waiting along the sand.
Cast your sweet spell upon the land and sea.

Magus Perd&#233;, take your hand from off the chain.
Loose a wish to still, the rain, the storm about to BE.
Here am I (voyager into life).
Tough are the soles that tread the knife's edge.
Break the circle, stretch the line, call upon the devil.
Bring the gods, the gods' own fire.
In the conflict revel.
The passengers upon the ferry crossing, waiting to be born,
Renew the pledge of life's long song rise to the reveille horn.
Animals queuing at the gate that stands upon the shore
Breathe the ever-burning fire that guards the ever-door.

Man - son of man - buy the flame of ever-life
(Yours to breathe and breath the pain of living): living BE!
Here am I! Roll the stone away
From the dark into ever-day.

<b>Epilogue</b>
There was a rush along the Fulham Road
Into the Ever-passion Play.

No cure for the social disease
Sex fiends, Acid Queens, livin' on a bad dream
This town never sleeps

Down in the city
Gettin' what you need
Down in the city
Make your poor heart bleed

Livin' by the trigger, always better if it's bigger
Won't catch me down on my knees
Shake it down, lay it down, Sin City all around
Hollywood's the city of sleaze
Loose change, no-names, lookin' for a fast way
To make it to the top ot the heap

Laughin' at the poor clown
Walkin' on his name in the street

Never should've wept when you let go
Never thought you'd push me away

Sad as it may be
I'm glad it's over finally
Speaks volumes of me
When letting go is never easy

So I'll seek you out, just to find myself
And I'll worry 'bout consequences later
I hear you out, till I hear myself
Hear myself in you

Never knew if we were really true
Never thought I'd ever get to you
Never thought I'd end up like this

Never was I stronger than I'm now
Never felt this much a fool somehow
Never had much thought for myself

When it's hard to forget how many lies we've told
Or how old we'd grow before I said goodbye
So let's scrape our knees on the playground

It's not your fault you feel okay
It's too late in the day
It's not your fault you feel betrayed
You can't come out to play
I never listened to a word you never said
I never listened to a word you never said

Wasting the hours now, we're all suckers for tragedies
And start this over again and you bring us to our knees
As sunrise comes and the story we will sell
There'll be a hundred papers so we'll follow you up

It's not your fault you feel okay
It's too late in the day
It's not your fault you feel betrayed
You can't come out to play
I never listened to a word you never said
I never listened to a word you never said
So raise your hands up high
And let this rain pour on
So raise your hands up high
And wash us away

Like innocence and childbirth
You look just like your mother and you look just like your father
Forgive him our father
Your son is smiling
So lay roses around you

Skaters, BMX-bike riders rock
Don't you ever stop! You are hip-hop
You doing the same things we did on our block in the suburbs
You know you be packing that black block
Selling that crackrock and ecstacy
Gettin' pissydrunk, fallin' out next to me
But like I told those in the ghettoes
Here's the facts! True hip-hop is so much more than that
Some much more than rap, so much more than beats
Hip-hop is all about victory over the streets
What you see on TV is a lie
That's not something you wanna live or pattern your life by
But, huh that's too much preachin' ain't it?
You don't want the ?education?, you wanna be dead on the pavement
Well, so be it, some of y'all ain't gonna see it
Others wanna enslave your mind! Kris wanna free it!

Rap is something you do!
5x Hip-Hop is something you live! *scratched*

""Oh yeah"" *scratched* --- From ""P is dead""

""I have spent my whole life livin'"", ""talk to the fullest"", ""no doubt""

(Kris)
You know that's why these rappers can't hang
Cause the essence of hip-hop is not a material thang
They so careless, hip-hop is in a {?} we give
Rap we do, hip-hop we live
How many times I gotta say it? How the radio ain't gonna play it
And you hip-hoppers sit back and okay it
Think about it! (think about it)
The present course of action, we have got to reroute it!

(Chorus: repeat 3X)
Hip-Hop is something you live!

Pushed your button, rang your bell, you didn't hear me knock

I ran to the top floor, but you were on the ground

Fire in the basement
Burn me up, scream and shout
There's fire in the basement
Only you can put it out

This strange sensation that I'm going through
Sweet infatuation when I get next to you
I know what it takes to be a man, you understand
'Cause when the sparks start flying you'll never be the same
You know I'll hate to leave you girl, but I'm so glad I came

Burn me up, scream and shout

And it's early for the coming of your age
And it breaks me, the decisions that we'll make

She cries so hard to please 
My restless feet, the rain in the street, and her vanity fair 
Sighs in the eyes of the boarding house lady who stares 
Thinking I care 

So it's a long dusty road 
Feelings I shouldn't have showed 
Follow me with a sweet heart when I'm ready to fade 
Lights like these burn so bright, keep me out of my shade 
Wish I could fade 

Just see me fade

Tucked in my shirt for every session, but hold up

Si estoy hundido en un vaiv&#233;n de caderas
Esto es el cielo, es mi cielo.

Amor fugado,
me tomas, me dejas, me exprimes,
y me tiras a un lado.

Te vas a otros cielos y regresas como los colibr&#237;s
Me tienes como un perro a tus pies.

Otra vez mi boca insensata,
vuelve a caer en tu piel,
Vuelve a mi tu boca y provoca,
Vuelvo a caer, en tus pechos, en tu par de pies.

Labios compartidos, labios divididos (mi amor)
Yo no puedo compartir tus labios.
Que comparto el enga&#241;o y comparto mis d&#237;as (y el dolor)
Ya no puedo compartir tus labios.

Oh amor, oh amor, compartido.

Amor mutante,
amigos con derecho y sin derecho de tenerte siempre.
Y siempre tengo que esperar paciente,
el pedazo que me toca de ti.

Rel&#225;mpagos de alcohol
las voces solas lloran en el sol.
Mi boca en llamas torturada,
te desnudas, &#225;ngel-hada, luego te vas.

Otra vez mi boca insensata,
Vuelve a caer en tu piel de miel,
Vuelve a m&#237; tu boca, &#161;duele!
Vuelvo a caer, en tus pechos, en tu par de pies.

Labios compartidos, labios divididos (mi amor)
Yo no puedo compartir tus labios.
Que comparto el enga&#241;o y comparto mis d&#237;as (y el dolor)
Ya no puedo compartir tus labios.

Que me parta un rayo,
que me entierre el olvido (mi amor)
Pero no puedo m&#225;s compartir tus labios,
compartir tus besos,
labios compartidos.

Te amo con toda mi fe sin medida,
te amo aunque est&#233;s compartida,
tus labios tienen el control.

Te amo con toda mi fe sin medida,
te amo aunque est&#233;s compartida,
tus labios tienen el control.
Y sigues t&#250; con el control.

With eyes closed tightly
I march so blindly
Pretending everything's fine
'Cause you're there to keep me in line
I don't want your guidance
I'll break my silence
So sick of asking and being denied and now I realise

We're holding the key, to unlock our destiny
We were born to lead
We're finally free, no longer following
We were born to lead
We were born to lead

You can't ignore me (you can't ignore me)
You can't think for me (you can't think for me)
Your world will come crashing down to the ground
'Cause I figured you out

We're holding the key, to unlock our destiny
We were born to lead
We're finally free, no longer following
We were born to lead
We were born to lead

I don't think so!
Not in my outfit, ladies!
I don't think so!

We were born to lead

I use to think I'm all alone
But now I see our numbers grow
I'm not afraid to break away
Think on my own

Y'all better not be afraid to break my will!
I will break your will!
You people are a mess!

With eyes wide open
My new life begins
Without you there to tell me, when, where and how
And you can't stop me now

We're holding the key, to unlock our destiny
We were born to lead
We're finally free, no longer following
We were born to lead
We were born to lead

We're holding the key, to unlock our destiny
We were born to lead
We're finally free, no longer following
We were born to lead

Not today ladies, not today!
Not yesterday, not today, and not tomorrow!
Not in my outfit!
It doesn't happen that way!
It happens the way I say it happens!
You may think you're born to lead!
I've got news for you, girl scouts!
You have to learn to follow!

Open up your eyes

Be a g
I started off playing basketball for my coach He started hatin' so I took a
Different approach
I'm a rap, fuck sweatin, And I'ma do something (like what?) that a nigga won't
Be regretin
Could I rob, no. Could I steal, no. Could I jack, no. Should I kill, no.
Nah, I gotta get my shit together, Cause a nigga need a house and big furniture
With the leather
I pick up the pen, I pick up the pace, And I used to be broke I couldn't even
Pick up my face
But now, listen to the shit a nigga be going, while you niggas think of the
Nigga could for real be ruined
From smokin' and drinkin', drinkin' and smokin', and I'm a try to go platinum while
You thinkin' and hopin
Wishin and lookin' tryna do what I do, and if you fuck with me I'll shoot or
I'll sue
And how you wanna handle business I can get it like that, And sellin work on the
Block I used to get it like that
But I had to back back and open up my eyes, When you runnin' in these streets
You might get a surprise
Your friend could be a foe, your girl could be a hoe
And everybody you think got your back your don't know
Duke been here before a nigga got rick, So Duke right here when I'm ridin' in my

My niggas siz make beats for me everyday, and guess what? He don't ever ask to
Get paid
My nigga red keep it real, hump got my back, When I didn't have a car, hump
Bought a lac,
Now Hump bought a jag and I'm in it, runnin' through these ho's but my name
Ain't Emmit

And it's a fact
Everybody similin ain't your friend Everybody with a grin contemplatin on your
Man
And it's a fact
Your reap what you sow, better watch what you doing 'cause if your do it to
Somebody they gonna do it to you
And it's a fact
Your best friend will turn his back on ya, pull a gat on ya, even rat on ya
And it's a fact
That most niggas act like hoes
It's a fact
That most niggas act like hoes

Now who can you trust who can you depend on., when you all broke need money to
Lend on
When you try to ball and your money been gone, when you try to put a down
Payment on ten homes
Will your nigga ride for you, or will your ngga bust, will your nigga come and
Get your ass out them cuffs
Will your nigga take you to the mall to buy some clothes, will your nigga ever
Put you first before them hoes
Will your nigga buy your drink and smoke up the weed, Ride for your ass when
They go shootin down the street
Come to your funeral and tell a fuckin' story, Think about the nuts that we took
With no glory
The category, the list, the rappin', the hoes
The hoes and the shows, it comes and it goes
De-Ant De-Ant De-Ant

If you ain't suckafree don't fuck with me
'Cause I know you got your eyes on my luxery
If you ain't suckafree don't fuck with me

393,"I remember a man who was true to himself, if he put his mind to something it was done, he could
Help everyone just by doing what he loved, he could work with his hands so good, but when no one
Cares to know, that he works them to the bone.

He comes home to himself and he sits in his chair, gets lost inside pictures on the wall, he's
Had some loves in his life that he's lost but knows why, he's lived with mistakes for so
Long... he's the best man that I know, he sleeps happy all alone, he gives me

Hope for the best in everyone, in understanding what we've done, I laugh to myself, it gives me
Hope for the best for what we lost, to understand when no one wants, it makes me laugh, it gives
Me hope.

I know this lady who grew up so quickly, she had a child when she was so young, without the time
Or money to pursue what she wanted, she slowly lost touch with her love, I bet she tried to run,
But she didn't have the guts to leave her, son who was born on a day in the spring, grew up to
Respect her so much, for all that she had lost and for never giving up, for loving the mistake
That she loved... well lady you deserve more than anyone I know, you give me

Hope for the best in everyone, in understanding what we've done, I laugh to myself, it gives me
Hope for the best for what we lost, to understand when no one wants, it makes me laugh, it gives
Me hope.

I'm sitting alone and I think to myself, it'd be great if people could know, if we wore big tags
Or we threw big parties where only lost people could go, so we'd never think we're wrong, and
We'd never feel alone... alone.

Think of the sprintime near my home
Keep making promises to me
We're talking to strangers all day
And when it's broken we'll fix it
Learning a lesson our own way

Dove down past the deep end
More strange with every season
I spend finding a new way
To replace the home that I once made.
We've seen twisters and fistfights
To this day it feels like a landmine
Touch if you want
You can blow up with us
It's so normal to feel confused.
Look at what I do...

Check out the sound in my headphones
Think of the springtime near my home
Keep making promises to me
We can declare our own time zone
Don't want to grow up to quickly
Yesterday feels like years away

Faster than you can say destiny
You don't have to change much to
Become the person you always were but couldn't see
Would you say you have the nerve to ask what tomorrow requires of you
Ask, ""How long till I can relax, I break my back for you.""

Think of the springtime near my home
Keep making promises to me

But it's paradise for me.

From the cradles to the stiff coffin, legit fortune
I lean for them corner fiends, crip-walking
Wedding-bells I'm out of that shell of slick talking
Honeymoon, deep scuba diving, kissing the dolphins
I lived though, I quit flossing, I forgive though this shit's costing
At the crib with the kids often, coasting
Ski-boating on the beach ocean
Hoping them old closed cases never re-open
Moving, y'all minor leagues, I'm like speed motion
Muscles through my white tee's woken, he's holding
Hypnotic, spit shit you sit and vibe wit, melodic
I mental escape through all the garbage

This is life (echo 4x)

One in a million, I'm strong young and appealing
Was born son a villain, put on in front of my building
Peeping how the street structure decease brothers
Critique, but I was placed here to reach others
Incomplete, stand feet from the deep cover
Eternal sleep, I wonder if the Beast love us
The frail weaken, the stronger be in jail eating
The average male will make it home if the bail's decent
I inhale frequent, it alleviate great, to be a part of the game
Can't be a day late to be a part of the same
Need a g' a day take, five if you live, slide mines on the side

This is life (echo 4x)

Mics, money and music my life's for you to view it
I stand militant, my stripes came from the sewage
Interrogation lights, spend nights up in the cubics
Fistfights, I'm nice like Earl Huvick
Harmonizing, narration is traumatizing
Here since '94, it's still kinda surprising
I touched topics, safe-boxes, unlocked it
Complete zone keep my tone on one octave
Owe nothing, won't ask to hold nothing
Clean behind the scene, but control buttons
Brought it back for the essence that got watered in rap
'Cause I'm a aura I bring more to track

I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes

One solemn vow to love honor and obey
Now we got nothing but the shame
And lame excuses

Hold me down but you won't hold me back
Somehow this bruise will be the last

With your tongue between your teeth
It's hard to walk
With only the eggshells underneath
The stabbing of winter white will reap
Fresh abuses

Hold me down but you won't hold me back

Hold me down but you won't hold me back...

Till the embers smoke on the ground
And start new
When your heart is an empty room
With walls of the deepest blue

Home's face
How it ages when you're away
And spring blooms
And you find the love that's true
But you don't know what now to do
'Cause the chase is all you know
And she stopped running months ago

And all you see
Is where else you could be when you're at home
And out on the street
Are so many possibilities to not be alone

The flames and smoke
Climbed out of every window
And disappeared
With everything that you held dear
And you shed not a single tear
For the things that you didn't need
'Cause you knew you were finally free

'Cause all you see
Is where else you could be when you're at home
And out on the street
Are so many possibilities to not be alone

Into my hands
Such a precious vibration

If I blew you a kiss
Would you put it in your pocket or on your lips
Or save it on your telephone
Would you miss it all together?

For the moment the outside world it dissipates
Into the sound unheard
Shooting through the satellites
I hold my breath I'm waiting...

Through the wire with digitalized urgency
Patiently...
Lips on receiver as you
Hold my world in your hands
And I know this means everything...
So I hear your voice with clarity
And I know this means everything
Hear your voice...

Is this kiss hello, goodbye
Perhaps goodnight
I'll see you again soon
I'll be waiting here forever...

The mobster, long coat and brim hat, staggered in the rain
Fallin', load the .38, breathin heavy, beneath a window pane
Sideways from cop cars {*cop sirens*}, echoes through his ears
And the rain blended with his tears, heart full of fear
He's exhausted from the loss of blood, his head is drowsy
He thought to his self, ""Damn, all the fake niggas around me""
So he fought off a thug, breathin heavy
With the weapon in his hand that he held was deadly
His face was sweaty
Damn, what you do when you at the door of life and death?
Plus you staggered 22 blocks, with a bullet in your chest
Plus you soakin wet
You might catch pneumonia, suddenly you smelt smell death's foul aroma
It burnt his nose hairs like ammonia
He inhaled deep then fell asleep
Opened his eyes in Hell
Where he saw every nigga he made the sale
Every crack addict with a bad habit
Every drug users and every needle abuser
Never knew he worked for Lucifer
He shut his eyes and opened them again (Yo)

But I'm not no hethen, 'cause I know without believing.

I was coming home from school late, So I took a walk through the park
Right before it got dark,
And I was trying to make it home before the dark start.
But you won't believe what I seen.
I seen some niggas, and they lady teasing,
I saw blood, and I seen the weapon.
And I was hearing the scream.
When them niggas noticed me,
I broke 'cause I'd just witnessed a killing.
And from that day on my mind has been gone look, you feeling me?

I I'll write my first love song and I will feel warm

Hide your eyes
In heaven in the lies

Overwhelmed with a deep repulsion for sights seen so commonly
Now I have come to be a walking enmity
For humanity, the human blasphemy
I'll end the world tonight

428,"I can feel the sands of time
Passing through the hourglass
And it shimmers in my eyes
As I linger in the wake
As eternity escapes
I begin to realize

We'll walk a thousand miles just to see for ourselves
Look behind our eyes
Find our hell
And in the light of the sun we go
Through rain and raging snow
To find the things we do not know

I will go
Never laying low
Just tell me how to breathe
And I will make it so
You must know
That this is not for show
And if you are not wise
(It will) Be your demise

Once I walked along a field
Another nightmare in my mind
And beheld the fearful symmetry
Everything was beautiful
Even things that were dead
And I surged with violent imagery

I walked a thousand miles just to see for myself
Looked behind my eyes
And found my hell
And in the light of the sun we go
Through rain and raging snow
To find the things we do not know

I will go
Never laying low
Just tell me how to breathe
And I will make it so
You must know
That this is not for show
And if you are not wise
(It will) be your demise

We come to honor; to stand or die
To pass the hours of our lives
We burn the silence and all the lies
To fuel the fire inside our eyes
We all go!

And in the light of the sun we go
Through rain and raging snow
To find the things we do not know

I will go
Never laying low
Just tell me how to breathe
And I will make it so
You must know
That this is not for show
And if you are not wise

Stand or die
Fuel that fire in your eyes

I am the conscience clear
In pain or ecstasy
And we were all weaned my dear
Upon the same fatigue

You're staring at the sun
Oh my own voice cannot save me now
It's just standing in the sea
One more breath 
And then I go down

Your mouth is open wide
The lover is inside
And all the tumults done
Collided with the sign
You're staring at the sun
You're standing in the sea
Your body's over me

Note the trees because the
Dirt is temporary
More to mine than fact face
Name and monetary

Beat the skins and let the
Loose lips kiss you clean
Quietly pour out like light
Like light, like answering the sun

Oh it's a damned fine game
And we can play all night</i>

Another New Year's Eve will ease our pain
Faith for the few
And rites that will make us so brave
So new

We laugh and we cheer for a happy New Year
Happy?

Candles burn down
And in the darkness future comes around
We smile, all aware
But never speaking of the masks we wear
Blind

Turning mirrors upside down  
Won't make dust fall off the ground  
Hiding wounds won't ease the pain  
Sleep won't make you whole again  
Change the inside
Drink the rain

Dressing our words
Seeing the dirt and flaws inside us hurts
One final glass
A sour taste from our promises
I bid farewell and crawl out of my shell

I'm awake
I see the mistakes I make
Hiding wounds won't ease the pain
Sleep won't make you whole again
Change the inside

Today I found a seed of sorrow
The harvest leaves a soil of shame
Now I undress and face tomorrow
And brave I walk to meet the blame

I'll search my home outside these borders
I'll run to meet up with the past
A resolution for the new life
This time I know it's gonna last

And I will
Change the inside
Drink the rain
Open my wounds to heal the pain
Learn the work of the machine

With the missing links, it don't feel like home now
That you're gone, all the troubles suddenly explained infinitum
You're always wishing and never here at home, you

All the dreams we shared and lights we turned on
But the house is getting dark
And I don't want to know your past
But together share the dawn

And I won't need nothing else 'cause when we're dead
We would've had it all
And I wouldn't falling from the sky, tell you
Parachutes have opened now

Heaven knows if there's a ceiling
Come so low with the kneeling
Please know that, that I got 
All the friends I'm needing, before my lights go out
As the doors are closing now 
And far away will be my home
And to grasp this, I don't know

But I don't need
Further back and forth, a wave will break on me today
And love
Wish the world could glow again with love
One can't seem to have enough

And war
Break the sky and tell me what it's for
I'll travel there on my own
And love
What a different life
Had I not found this love with you

We was claimin' the same hood fucked the same bitches
And they knew, if I hit it you had to hit it too, we was cruel
You was wit me when I first pulled the trigga
You tried to shoot two, but your gun jammed so we pulled off, remember?
I headed by your Mama house, for a couple of days
'Cause the niggas we was beefin' with, knew where I stayed
We was some down South niggas,
Boot in the mouth niggas
The wrong route niggas
Typical niggas
We'd just make a lil' dollar, sellin' weed to the needy
Everything be fifty/fifty ain't no need, for bein' greedy
You my dog, ha? So that's how we played it
Niggas who hated, we rushed and demonstrated
Why we ain't to be faded
On this mission with get money, power, and bitches
I would ever come along with these riches that's if nobody snitches
I do a bid for you, take care of your kid for you
But damn, look what these pussy niggas done did to you

If I had some beef with you I'd come to ya like a man,

Niggas, and these niggas got you...

Them niggas told you I blew up and I forgot about us
The same niggas who was with you, and afraid to bust
How could you listen to these niggas? When they mean no good?
Muthafuckas ain't even from our hood
And now you snortin' furl with em
Off in that World with em
Father forgive him he dancin' to some other rhythm
Ever thought that we could work it out?
We would meet,
But as long as you with them niggas I be with that heat
And that's deep,
'Cause I made a promise to your mama when we was only 12
I would deliver you from evil and keep you alive and well
Guess I gotta disappoint her, but you leave me no choice
Callin' my crib with this ""Murder, murder"" tone in your voice
What I'm a bitch or somethin'?
I used to fight for you,
Used to let you stay at my Mama crib when shit just wasn't right for you
Look what you do me in return
I guess I played with fire, so eventually it burns

Mi hanno fatto aspettare e sorridere e comprare
E spedito con un calcio nel didietro

Perdonami, madre
Ho lottato, ho bestemmiato ed ho pianto
Ma in fondo non &#232; niente

Ho ascoltato montagne di stupide opinioni
E miliardi di orribili canzoni
Le stesse promesse e le stesse parole
Nelle stesse piazze e manifestazioni
Mi hanno dato consigli e pacche sulle spalle
Interpellato per opere di bene
Mi hanno preso in disparte e tirato nel mezzo
E appiccicato bandiere sulla schiena

Ho perduto bandiere e posti di lavoro
Ho perduto caterve di occasioni
Ho perduto battaglie e compagni di viaggio
Oltre a qualche centinaio di elezioni
Ho troppe ferite e le mie gambe sono stanche
Ho le palle piene e i piedi fumanti
Ma c'&#232; un gioco da fare e una ruota che riparte
E un vagabondo sa che deve andare avanti

Where to, you'll never know...

Should you remain entire

Inside your dreams
Laugh into your face,
Set yourself on fire,
Burn inside, bleed inside -

To take your soul

Mentally sick, battle rap is a jail pick

Battle me and you're all dead, I'm taking niggas out with dreads
Blow outs and also bald heads, tracks

Now I'm king of the crooks, making money like I'm Garth Brooks
Will I die? Who's to say?
My brain is the maze of death, so choose your way
Get burnt like a candle, very hard to handle
Do miracles in Nikes like Jesus did in sandals

When I'm Writing
It's the artist within
When I'm Writing
I'm in tune with the Solomon books
When I'm Writing
It's more than just a song and a hook

(Killah Priest)
My pen's a crayon
With coloring books, displayin' chaos
The black seyance, with the ink pores radared
Age quasars explorin' where the mind caves are
A riches being dug from a keys graveyard
It's the inscription written on Egyptian clay jar
I write rhymes like I'm doing time
Listen, when I hit the pen I start doing the sickest
I got the flow locked behind each bar
And if I get too wild
You can throw me in the box of ya car, it's not that far
My pen's an airbrush, thrown over ya favorite sweater
My notebook's leather, I write with a feather
My pages look like a Renaissance painting
Visions of St. John's conquerin' Satan
All made from my imagination
It's Priest, Lord, the Bishop of Vikings
When I'm Writing

(Killah Priest)
The way that I write, it's like a painting
I put on aprons
And brush my ink pen across the palette
Stare at the projects
Till I see somethin', then write about it
My pad's a canvas, filled with anthems
And words from the black panthers
To crack scramblers, to crack gamblers
To gat handlers, to cats in handcuffs
Doin' life
I lock myself in a room and I write
Rhymes I could do a life-time
When everything's relaxed
And I'm in my right mind
I sit still for months like a monk
Till Buddha bless me and grant me
With the wishes that I want
I want a thesaurus with clairvoyants
I rhyme for the enjoyment, my mind voyages
Ever since the day that man evolved
Scrapin' white chalk on candy walls
From the Stone Age of neanderthals
I've been writing

472,"Caught in a world that's plagued by something they called love
A paradigm of illness is the beast I have become
The sights that I have seen could nearly bring me to my knees
I've seen exactly what it is I never want to be

But I keep it deep inside myself
It's within me
Keep it deep within yourself and sink with me

Last night I had the misfortune to see it all first hand
""Evacuate the premises"" was the innate first command
What drives the need for all of this
And will I ever understand
Has someone failed to tell me of this master plan

But I keep it deep inside myself
It's within me
Keep it deep within yourself and sink with me

Dirty South, Westcoast, check it what

Will the streets beat me up, man I'm not fa sho

But there's gotta be a way, that I can get that do'

I ain't never had nothing, 'less I got it myself
Being broke and hungry man, yeah it's bad for your health
I'm trying to stay out the heat, cause the sun is blazing
Gotta take it slow, I got a son I'm raising
Ain't nothing promised to you, better reach for the sky
That's the only limit man, time passing us by
Now it's do or die, ain't no bowling it down
Yeah it's been a long grind, but I'm holding it down
Ain't no turning it back, so I devour
All I know is greed, getting money and having power
In this lifetime, I seen it all my man
I'm trying to stash in the country, with some acres and land

It's been a tough day, so I'ma blow my wig back
And I ain't got time to bullshit man, I stay on a stack
Where your nuts at, you ain't shit without em
Trying to get up to the top, 'cause I come from the bottom
It's a sacrifice, that we all gotta make
Gotta get your grind on, come up pounds and cakes
I'ma get mine on, in the city or state
I ain't trying to fall short, I'm putting meat on the plate
I gotta feed shorty, and take care of my boo
Be there for T. Lady, 'cause she always true
But I'ma hold on, everybody stand tall
And just roll on, you know me and my people
We staying so strong, and it's like that
So if you hit me on the cell, I'll hit you right back

Popeye, you could never drop by, you can never stop by
Cause you can never top I

You're a mic stand, got a steady woman
But I been in more sheets than the Klu Klux Klan
I'm the J to the Ro, and I want to make it clear
That you're rappin' like a queer so why don't you get on out of here
With the alley cat coat wearin' Hush Puppy shoes

Yes, I""m the man with the skills to talk shit
And I'm back by the crew that none of y'all can get with
So back to the lab to fix your demo

And watch a nigga jump on a motherfucker like cheese and a rat

You show me how it would be if I'd gone the other way

But You've rectified my frailty by your strength 
It's like the sun swallowed up by the earth
Like atomic bombs in reverse
As if a glass could contain the sea
That's the way You are in me
That's the way You are

Now here I stand looking back
To the way things used to be
But I will never be alone again 
'Cause You're with me
And now I see
What it means to me
To be a part of such a mystery

Is there any blood in your veins?

When I need them?

Save me from this madness baby
Save me from the shame
Save me from this feeling baby
Wipe these damn tears away

That easily break
I got feelings that I just can't escape
I got dreams that mostly
Just keep me awake

Save me from this madness baby
Save me from the shame
Save me from this feeling baby
Wipe these damn tears away

You got my soul in your solar system
But you keep my heart out of hand
As if I'm only human

I leaned instead of jiggie with the sidewalk
Now this street tells the same old boring tale that has failed in so many ways of life
To trust its stories you've got to be dull as them

And all the love I've got in here
You've just killed, you peasants didn't even care
The love I had in store you raped for more
And all the dreams I had in here you've just stolen
You peasants didn't even care
But the dreams I had for her you cannot touch, my golden hand
'Cause it's guarded by your promises

I met her in a crowded room where the bookshelves help you and knowledge takes your hand
I watched her beauty from an armchair
I said ""Hey girl have you seen that film with those kids in New York in the eighties
Oh, you have - Well, can I watch it with you anyway?""

And all the love I've got in here
You've just killed, you peasants didn't even care
The love I had in store you raped for more
And all the dreams I had in here you've just stolen
You peasants didn't even care
But the dreams I had for her you cannot touch, my golden hand
'Cause it's guarded by your promises

Congratulation Mr. Major you savior, betrayer, you stinking master of trusts
How does it feel to ride all those horses?
You cannot touch our hearts when we're in bloom
I assume that we'll win over the heads again
We conceal none, you'll feel none, that's what I promise
And all the love we've got in store, you can't kill you peasants! We won it all
And the love I have for her you cannot touch, my golden hand
'Cause it's guarded by your filthy promises

And all the love I've got in here
You've just killed you peasants didn't even care
The love I had in store you raped for more
And all the dreams I had in here you've just stolen
You peasants didn't even care
But the dreams I had for her you cannot touch, my golden hand
'Cause it's guarded by your promises, yeah, yeah, yeah

Honey I love you, like the summer falls
And the winter crawls
You're above and beyond me

And the winter crawls
You're above and beyond me

480,"Stutter-step to the beat of a disparaged lover
Dumb and pulsing we've become
The bedroom door is an old black lung; It's arrhythmic
Uninviting and pliable

With the noble irreverence of shrapnel she came for us
Bore into our heads and found thoughtlessness
Never minded the faithless courage of shame or the bravery of oblivion

When I'm on her mind
I'm never coming back
If two timing's what it takes
Then we'll both know
One take
Is all we need
We're not equipped to stay unloved
But it's all we've got and we're not at all alright

Come on baby and give me the creeps, yea

Either you or I or both must go
Either you or I or both must go

But it's all we've got and we're not at all alright

There's no difference between being holy and alone
That's why I'm eagerly fleeing the scene
Lead footed
Baby return the favor and leave somebody you love
If they come back they're drunk and they're lonely
We all get lonely

God forbid we indulge when at sea
Just the tempest, the temptress and me
Naturally bored thriller
Nobody knows the trouble I've been
Or the exacting improvement of sin
I'm handing myself over
I'm turning myself in
War has no glory like a woman ignored
So here's to the empires polluted with dead
And the truckers' wives who erected them

I know the stripper's real name

Stop me if I'm wrong

Rollin' my 67

Bumpin' that old Sugar Hill
Today I'm living proof
Your worst fear came true
I'm doing all right without you baby
I'm leaving all that darkness behind me
Making changes in my life
So when that sunshine finally finds me
I can stand fully in the light
Spread my wings and reach for sky
I never felt so alive
Kiss my kids goodnight
Tell 'em Daddy's all right I'm all right

Honey child there's a whole world waiting on you
Took a while but we finally made it through
Go 'head you can smile now all that darkness' behind you
Smile. Smile. Smile.

Almost drowned but I survived
She held me under for 5
Years of my life
But today I'm living proof
Your worst fear came true
I'm doing all right without you baby yes I am
I'm leaving all those grudges behind me
Throwing fear out the window
So when these blessings come to find me
They will have room to breathe and grow
Let my blessings overflow and get my life under control
So my kids will know, Daddy finally let go

I know that once I have found you the sun will come.

Throughout all time I will wait for you somewhere,
I know that long as I'm waiting the sun will come.

She took my hand, and she waits for the sinner,
Such a strange place that she waits for the sun to come.

489,"Jackknifed my strife
Take it easy, sit outside
I just died a thousand times yesterday

Lay down. drown out
Drowning in these cries and shouts
Changing so fast that it stays the same

Encryption ensconces this cryptic clich&#233;
If it's not stupid, it's more of the same
I'm too tired to care, we're too busy to think
Let's sit back and laugh and watch the ship sink

The hull and the bow and the smokestacks
Disappeared and we watched it go down
With a screaming Bronx cheer, thank you dear
I will sleep and get up and eat unaware

But don't forget to forget that you forgot me
When I show up at your door
I'm gonna remember that you are my friend
And fall asleep on your floor

Winter is coming, can you find your coat?
Let's go watch the water while the bodies still float
Slit my throat, it's more than a tad overdue
Slit my throat, I can't die in here till next June

I breathed, it was smoky
I cried and it steamed
I dreamed that I slept
And I actually dreamed

What it is a sickness
What it is is regret
And I might be dying
But I'm not dead yet

But don't forget to forget that you forgot me
When I show up at your door
I'm gonna remember that you are my friend
And fall asleep on your floor

Winter is coming, can you find your coat?
Let's go watch the water while the bodies still float
Slit my throat, it's more than a tad overdue
Slit my throat, I can't die in here till next June

I breathed, it was smoky
I cried and it steamed
I dreamed that I slept
And I actually dreamed

What it is a sickness
What it is is regret
And I might be dying
But I'm not dead yet

But don't forget to forget that you forgot me
When I show up at your door
I'm gonna remember that you are my friend
And fall asleep on your floor

Uh uh (yeah yeah)

I was in love wit' you (yeah)
And you couldn't do no wrong in my eyes
When I found out the scoop on you (yeah)
It was still too hard for me to realize
That I needed to be through' wit you (yeah)
'Cause you're the reason I can't eat or sleep (yeah)
All the girls you runnin' through (yeah)
Used to be best friends, down wit' me

When I'm gone, you're alone
You stickin' them chickens till I get home
When I'm home, you're wit' me
Kissin' on my ass, tryna be wit' me
Well it's done, this I know
Seen it for myself, I'ma let you know
You don't play, games wit' me
But before I go, betta leave my dough

I'ma fool for you (yeah)
But you seem to think my love's a joke (it ain't a joke boo)
I get no love from you (yeah)
Like all these times I did before
I think I'll pass on you (yeah)
Because of the way you been actin' lately
I get no cash from you (yeah)
If you want me to stay, you must be cra-crazy

When I'm gone, you're alone
You stickin' them chickens till I get home
When I'm home, you're wit' me
Kissin' on my ass, tryna be wit' me

Seen it for myself, I'ma let you know
You don't play, games wit' me

I want it al' from the motherfuckin' house, down to the dogs
You trickin' off with these chickens, I thought you ain't have no flaws
Keep yo dick in they jaws, Peter shoulda stayed in his draws
Now I'm out the door and you can't claim me no more
The loss is yours
How you gonna slumber wit' a bitch I'm supposed to be cool wit'
Went to grade school wit', couldn't pay me to believe you hit it
To think I footed all the bills and now you breakin'
Stop accusin' me of that dumb shit I don't even participate in
You wasted my valuable time there's money to make
Scared to set foot in another relationship 'cause of the heartache
Heartbreak Hotel no not Faith, Kelly, and Whitney, no it's Brat, Aaliyah and
Missy You miss me 'cause we finished
I'll just keep the keys to the 20 inch rim ride with the TVs in it
You don't need it, beat it, it's mine
Kiss my ass like your heart was in it (stupid ass)
Keep stickin' them chickens
Send Peter straight to the clinic nigga

See I'ma give you your props tho
You like a bad ass motherfucker
Runnin' two bitches at one time
When I'm flyin' out, she flyin' in
Sayin' the same shit, spittin' the same game
Who the fuck you think I am
Willy Limpdick or somebody, forget you man
That's why us bitches gonna stick together

You tried to make it on the borderline
Now I can't help you treating you with deep disgust
Cause too much set me wondering in past

You don't stick to what you say at all
But now your lies are catching up with you
I can't see no friendship beneath your facade
Your true intentions are to feed your pride

[Chorus:] Bleed
You're a liar
Go away
You're a shame to me

Your game is slyly played, but at what a stake
Friends ain't toys to play with as you like
Spin'em around with flatteries, then suck'em out
Will it ever get stuck in your throat?

I didn't ask at all for your short temper and demanding

Look... when we first hooked up my first thought was you're a pansy
You couldn't even rap on beat, you little four-eyed geek
(Prev)
Yeah? And at the club there's a reason we don't hang out that much
You're double fisted with two Heinekens, acting like a lush

Constants of fate, never thought to be bent
The fields of destiny already are prepared
Failure and glory are not to be shared

The human's spirit is now free
Forever gone all agony
All rules are crumbling to dust
Absurd beliefs gone in a gust

In the eyes of an angel a heavenly glare
On the other side a demonic stare
The wings of light face the winds of time
The wings of darkness in a blistering line
The armies clashing at each other on the plains
Twisted features frozen on an angel's face
Demon's corpse dissolves in a blaze of flames
