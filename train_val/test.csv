0,"I stepped out off the train at dawn
Walked along an open road
To find you

You made beds at the gold motel
Sold junk at the carousel
To bind you

Lolita
You make my wheel, set me free,
Won't you come home with me?

We used to meet at the waterfall
Pink heather on the falling wall
Nothing to prove

Drank beer from a stolen can
Smoke cigarettes when we can
Because we like to

Lolita
You make my wheel, set me free,
Won't you come home with me?

Memories tangled up the spokes that
Make my wheel,
Make my wheel,
Oh everything has gone wrong!

I left you at the gold motel
Selling junk at the carousel
That bound you down
Can't find you now

Lolita
You make my wheel, set me free,
Won't you come home with me?

I've pushed them away, and I feel alone, and I feel alone

Wait for something more, I will shed
This part of me...

Wait for something more, I will shed
This part of me...

Take my will from me, you burn my eyes
But I can't see

Confuse our lives for misery
You lock me out, and throw away the key
And I feel alone

And I feel alone

Yeah

Wait for something more, I will shed
This part of me...

Wait for something more, I will shed
This part of me...

Yeah

Every morning now I wake up on the wrong side
Every morning now I wake up on the wrong side
Every morning I wake up on the wrong side
Every morning now I wake up on the wrong side

But every morning now I wake up on the Wrong Side
But every morning now I wake up on the Wrong Side
But every morning now I wake up on the Wrong Side
But every morning I wake up on the Wrong Side

Every morning I wake up on the Wrongside

2,"An old fairytale told me
The simple heart will be prized again
A toad will be our king
And ugly ogres our heroes

Then you'll shake your fist at the sky
""Oh, why did I rely
On fashions and small fry?""

All promises broken
Feed your people or lose your throne
And forfeit your whole kingdom
I'd sooner lose it than still live in it alone

You were our golden child
But the gentle and the mild
Inherit the earth

While your prince's crown cracks and falls down
Your castle's hollow and cold
You've wandered so far from the person you are
Let go, brother, let go
Because now we all know

Soon someone will put a spell on you
Perfume, treasure, sorcery, every trick they know
You will lie in a deep sleep
That's when your prince's crown cracks and falls down
Your castle hollow and cold
You've wandered so far from the person you are
Let go, brother, let go
Because now we all know

First of all, I don't know WHO, y'all saw on this stage before me (aight)
I don't know WHO, y'all gonna see on this stage after me (true)
But THIS, is REAL... HIP... HOP! Worrrrrd UP!
I'm gonna find out tonight, where the real hip-hop

[Intro] + (live response)
The real hip hop is (ova here!)
The real hip hop is (ova here!)
The real hip hop is (ova here!)
Real hip hop is (ova here!)

Bla-blaow! Bla-blaow!
Clear 'em out, clear 'em out - word!
{*Scratching: ""Aww yeah!"", ""The real hip-hop, is ova here""*}
{*Scratching: ""KRS, come get up in they asses""*}

(Verse One)
You ain't Fo'Reel and you ain't Universal
Your whole style sounds like a infomercial
You ignoramus, I'm the baddest with the mic apparatus
Challengin the God of rap is madness, I'll snatch your status
With these elders lookin' at Billboard you could stop them
But I got enough albums to make my OWN top ten!
You limited, like the spread of traffic
You bite my style off the radio
So when you speak in fact I hear the static
You better Chillout like Chuck, I kick like three Norrises
One of my sixteen bar rhymes is eight of your choruses
Of course it is, ridiculous
Watch out, I be in the club inconspicuous
Gotcha, on your, hands and knees
Ain't it about time for some real MC's?

[Chorus] + (live response)
The real hip hop is (ova here!)
The real hip hop is (ova here!)
Real hip hop is (ova here!)
Real hip hop is (ova here!)

(KRS-One)
Yo yo, Beatminerz, turn up the track a little bit
Gonna do this right now

(Verse Two)
Remix it, don't re-fix it
First brigade, second brigade - all swords lifted
Formation, classified information
Code red rhyme style accurate articulation
Don't test my foreign relation
The cats in Brixton, Birmingham and London just waitin
Got my cats in France like ill
Even Africa's laughin' at'cha right along with Brazil
The West Indies? Jus' wan fi kill
Got Canada mad at'cha, Germany heard of me, they seen the skill
Hip-Hop is more than a thrill to us
A dollar bill to us, believe you will trust in that
'Cause if you bust at me, on TV, CD
Internet trust that, I WILL BUST BACK
I turn down heat real quick, when I spit
You need the medicine what I speak is so sick
Then again these veteran be better than many men
Forever we hit 'em again better than ANY trend they could ever say
In any season, hot warm cold or freezin
When it comes to MCin, we believe in rhymin for a different reason
No frontin, my rhyme style tells you somethin'
They rhyme style tells you who they freakin
But you was already told - what does it profit a man
To gain the whole world and lose his soul?

4,"Long ago, the world was one
We walked through the ice floes
To an unenduring land
Our future, our hope
There was something in the air,
The Age of the Unknown
Far beyond the sea of trees
The vision laid close

There's a place where the sun shines brighter
There's a mountain that climbs to the stars...

Day and night we built a reign
With heavenly desire
Sweat and dreams made up the bricks
That raised up our walls

Paying tribute to the gods
And blood kept on flowing
And the lust for knowledge
Was the sense of it all

Fly, fly to the stars,
Reach them on high
Bring back the answers of the night
Roll with the clouds,
Sing with the birds,
'Cause one day we'll have to say goodbye!

Here we go, carrying no longer sorrow
Standing up in the wind
Walk along, marching on for tomorrow
In this neverending way

Many years of harmony
The message arrived soon
Three big stars lined up together
A chill in the air...

The high-priest was dressed in black
On top of the stairways
Longing for the sacrifice
Of those who would dare

Fly, fly to the stars
Then let it fall
Into the emptiness of night
Our time has come
Time to move on
'Cause one day we have to say goodbye...

Here we go, carrying no longer sorrow
Standing up in the wind
Walk along, marching on for tomorrow
In this neverending way

Come with me to Paradise
Let's return again,
Let's return again!

To be closer to the skies
Living on a dream,
Living on a dream...

Here we go, carrying no longer sorrow
Standing up in the wind
Walk along, marching on for tomorrow
In this neverending way

5,"I've been to all the familiar places
I've been running like a sentence never begun
I've been looking for a way to let you know
I've got nothing left to fill the spaces
I've got nothing but a centre coming undone
I've been doing circles and it shows

I've been to all
I've been to all

I've been to all the familiar places
I've been running like a sentence never begun
I've been looking for a way to let you know
I've got nothing left to fill the spaces
I've got nothing but a centre coming undone
I've been doing circles and it shows

Every cloud in the sky
Every place that I hide
Tell me that I
I was wrong to let you go
Every sound that I hear
Every thought that I fear
Tell me that I
I was wrong
I was wrong to let you go

Let you go
Let you go
Let you go

It's the little things that make you crazy
Like the thought of someone touching your skin
I can see you everywhere I go
You could be inside a sea of faces
It could be the rumour of your grin
Swimming in the river as it flows

Every cloud in the sky
Every place that I hide
Tell me that I
I was wrong to let you go
Every sound that I hear
Every thought that I fear
Tell me that I
I was wrong
I was wrong to let you go

Every cloud in the sky

6,"Do you remember how it was when you bled?
When you loved and burned in those flames that you've kept,
Because Vesta's long been sleeping.
Now you've come to accept that
Your anatomy defines more than a few of the gaping holes in our social fabric,
And it defines more than a few one night stands,
More than a few prison bars melted,
Melted in, melted in, melted into wedding bands.

We've made you all the peasants and we've made ourselves the kings,
Our queens are still subordinate as an angel without wings.
But we make it easy to be hung which means it's easy to be wrong,
""Put some plastic in your tits, and you'd look better as a blonde.""

I remember when you were hopeful,
And you never thought your life would be lived inside a coffin
With a moral sacrifice and a million social obligations, labels and expectations,
When you were young and modern seventeen,
In vogue and vague pursuit of the cosmopolitan dream.

So when you bled on the bed as you fed those expectations
As a whore and not a human you embraced with hesitation
The very parameters of all you can be:
Not a mother, not an aunt, not a sister who's not subdued,
Because dignity is not physical and your flesh means more than you.

Your flesh means more than you.
Your flesh means more than you.
Your flesh means more than you.


I know we'll wake up one day with a gun to the back of our brains.
You'll be asking for your rib and I'll smile and call you brave.

Maybe someday when,
When this bloody skull has dried
I'll know our city is in ruins
When our greatest source of pride
Is a monument of dicks and ribs
And the gender crowns we wore
Where underneath, a plaque will read,
A plaque will read...
""No woman is a whore.""

Maybe someday when,

I'll know our city is in ruins
When our greatest source of pride

8,"Over the mountains, and under the sky
Riding dirty gray horses, go you and I.
Mating with chance, copulating with mirth
The sad-glad paymasters (for what it's worth).

The ice-cream castles are refrigerated;
The super-marketeers are on parade.
There's a golden handshake hanging 'round your neck,
As you light your cigarette on the burning deck.

And you balance your world on the tip of your nose
Like a sealion with a ball, at the carnival.

You wear a shiny skin and a funny hat
The almighty animal trainer lets it go at that.
You bark ever-so-slightly at the trainer's gun,
With you whiskers melting in the noon-day sun.

You flip and you flop under the big white top
Where the long-legged ring-mistress starts and stops.
But you know, after all, the act is wearing thin
As the crowd grows uneasy and the boos begin.

But you balance your world on the tip of your nose
You're a sealion with a ball at the carnival.

Just a trace of pride upon our fixed grins
For there is no business like the show we're in.
There is no reason, no rhyme, no right
To leave the circus 'til we've said good-night.

The same performance, in the same old way;
It's the same old story to this passion play.
So we'll shoot the moon, and hope to call the tune
And make no pin cushion of this big balloon.

Look how we balance the world on the tips of our noses,
Like sealions with a ball at the carnival.

<i>Would you like another cup of tea, dear?</i>

es un muro perfecto, una m&#225;quina ciega, un laberinto borgiano
Puede ser sutil o transparente, a veces una bestia prepotente
pero no intentes pon&#233;rtele al frente, pues si te acercas te aplasta

No hay movimiento, no hay acci&#243;n ni beneficio, no hay transa, no has transa, no hay transa
no hay lugar donde no alcanza su gran tenaza omnipresente

Es un reptil que se multiplica
No vales nada si no formas parte de alg&#250;n engranaje
No vales nada de d&#237;a
No vales nada sin su protecci&#243;n en la noche
No vales nada de noche

Por m&#225;s que intelectuales lo disecten este dinosaurio no se muere

Y no se muere

In your world, there is only you
In my world, there is only you

Your words are shivers down my spine
I'm numb and shapeless in your web, in your web

Nadie con un cuento para m&#237;

There's leeches stealing across the stage
Come hell or ocean water
I won't end up without
Applaud the gall of the black cloud
Groping a drunken teenage vow
As saline drips from her prom dress, damp hands are desiccated
There's a wolf at the window of the second floor
Who kidnaps your date with a new car

We both want the same thing
Bad poetry and assaults at the bar
Just try and stop me
We are the only one in the world

Prepare the ballroom
Quicksand in front of the coat check
Waltz with the scarecrow in the spotlight through the rye
I was born a wanted man
But I'll die a sailor's wife
God help me pick the lock to her room

I have to make this right
Scream the hounds to sleep for me
I'm creeping around in your head like a vine

Your spit is the meat
Of the rose harvested by the dull
Let fly the doves,
Unhook their leather wings from the fog
Put your foot and mouth together
For the sweethearts of Vietnam

In a photo taken of us
At the reception held at the jail
Loverboy is breaking up
Just to the right side of me

I will stop at nothing
I am the siren that sings you home
Is that clear?
I will stop at nothing
I am the tooth in your jewelry box
Is that clear?

Let pry the crows
Unhook their crooked beaks from the clock

Bolt the gate and head for the ivory tower
Adoration is cutting the phone lines to your heart
Love is here

I am the snarling and starry-eyed

We both want the same thing
Better aim at the stranger in our yard
Just try to stop me
I am the blinding light of your life

Wait with the scarecrow for the spotlight in the rye

I'll eat you alive

We tried to keep them running, but there's no more oil around

20,"And have you been to the carnival
I would like to see you
There's a whole lot of people there
Who would like to be you

With the white unicorn
Across her shoulder
Makes you think that she might have been
Someone who's older, yeah

And I know it's on your mind
We've been drinking on the wine
That we drank from the serpent's vine
Now we live in another time

We could live together
We could live together

She lives on the borderline
That they call hazel
And the tent that she lives in
It has the name of her lover

And I know it's on your mind
We've been drinking on the wine
That we drank from the serpent's vine
Now we live in another time

Sister can you tell me when the day turns to night?
She left without a word and wondered inside
How many days must I still wonder why
And see her face in every passerby?

We could live together
We could live together

And I know it's on your mind
We've been drinking on the wine
That we drank from the serpent's vine
Now we live in another time

We could live together
We could live together
We could live together

21,"""He who makes a beast out of himself gets rid of the pain of being man""

Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
I tried to drive all through the night
The heat stroke ridden weather, the barren empty sights
No oasis here to see, the sand is singing deathless words to me

Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone)
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone)
No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention

As I adjust to my new sights the rarely tired lights will take me to new heights
My hand is on the trigger I'm ready to ignite
Tomorrow might not make it but everything's all right
Mental fiction, follow me; show me what it's like to be set free

Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone)
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone)
No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention

So sorry you're not here I've been sane too long my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me but don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem

Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
These eyes won't see the same, after I flip today

Sometimes I don't know why we'd rather live than die
We look up towards the sky for answers to our lives
We may get some solutions but most just pass us by
Don't want your absolution 'cause I can't make it right
I'll make a beast out of myself, gets rid of all the pain of being a man

Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone)
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone)
No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention

So sorry you're not here I've been sane too long my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me but don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem
I've known it from the start all these good ideas will tear your brain apart
Scared but you can follow me I'm too weird to live but much too rare to die

Sheitan never came so ill, he got skill
Met a brother from the drill that gave my spine chills
All thirty-three nerves controlling my curves
Common sense just swerved every time I got served
Stress, frustration, empty rhetoric
Cold as winter in Connecticut, compassion lacking deficit
Thought it was love like sent from above
You not a soul-mate, more ways and actions of a primate
Who by low and census coming faker than extensions
Pissed away all good intentions outta here. sister was missin'
Intuition, maybe it was me

War wound, purple heart, love veteran
Morphine, pain killers, drugs and medicine

And the POW's get left behind
Mentally scarred for life, love is war
And some chicks are just too hard to wife

Forsake God for the scent of a man
Sacrifice a whole life for a slice, overstand?
Maybe it's a lack of pigment, loneliness imagine figment
Only got the car tinted to pull extra G's in it

23,"Jag sitter hos kuratorn och vi r&#246;r oss inom ramen
F&#246;r allt fr&#229;n f&#246;rsta fyllan till tji studentexamen
I skvallerstan d&#228;r man blev f&#246;dd och formad och bedragen
Av plugg och bud och borgerskap och Gud och jantelagen
Man h&#228;mmades av hygglighet och kn&#228;cktes av kutym
S&#229; damp man ner i storstan, knappast fri men anonym

Jag tog ett andetag och st&#246;p av luften p&#229; perrongen
Och vaknade men jacken p&#229; den vajande batongen
""Hur var det h&#228;r d&#229;"" sa konstapeln, jag sa ""Atmosf&#228;ren
&#196;r ju ingenting man fryser p&#229;"" och satte mej p&#229; tv&#228;ren
Jag tog mej till hotellet d&#228;r portiern i sin svid
S&#229;g irriterad ut och jag var klart paranoid

Jag bad om enkelrum, han bad om namn p&#229; f&#246;retaget
Jag sa ""F&#246;rl&#229;t, hursa"", d&#229; log han listigt och f&#246;rslaget
Och sa ""Tv&#229;hundranitti kronor tack, rum hundrafjorton""
Jag sa ""Beh&#229;ll din nyckel du och kyss mej under stort&#229;n""
Jag v&#228;nde som en furie och gick till n&#228;rmsta bar
Och vr&#228;kte i mej whisky som en t&#246;rstig dromedar

Sen gick jag ut i natten som en v&#228;rldsvan salamander
Och smorde kr&#229;set och blev h&#246;g som kejsar Alexander
Med arvet p&#229; min bankbok men p&#229; krogen svor och slet man
Jag sa ""Vem &#228;ger plejset"", kyparn sn&#228;ste ""Tore Wretman""
Sen gick jag ut och tog en trick och gick till Gamla Bro
Och tog en holk och polarn garva ""H&#228;lsa V&#228;rnamo""

Men n&#228;r jag bytte dialekt, sa polarn ""Har'u feber
Du l&#229;ter som en rixtassman, en bildad sk&#229;nestreber""
Men jag stod p&#229; och k&#228;ftade i banken och aff&#228;ren
Som en ara, som en byr&#229;krat i karri&#228;ren
Dom sa ""Du som e fr&#229;n bystan, vaff&#246; snackar'u s&#229;d&#228;r""
Jag sa ""Jag &#228;lskar kula stan, jag bor och jobbar h&#228;r""

N&#229; hursomhelst, jag dr&#246;mde bort varenda dag i s&#228;ngen
Och dolde mej i dimman och d&#246;k in i pundarsv&#228;ngen
Jag br&#228;nde av mitt arv, man var v&#228;l ingen gniden lantis
Och flykten var ju uppenbar, men kicken var gigantisk
Jag t&#228;nde av och t&#228;nkte ""Mors, va e're h&#228;r f&#246;r strul""
Och drog tillbaks till morsan &#8211; inte fan var det n&#229;' kul

Men jag blev pigg i pallet och tog parti i valet
F&#246;r folket mot tyranner, klerikat och kapitalet
Och kom till stan igen och skrek fem g&#229;nger i kvarteret
Att Mao var stor och klampade v&#228;l ofta i klaveret
Jag var en kommunist som inte vuxit ur sin kolt
Mot &#197;gren och hans anhang hj&#228;lpte ingen majrevolt

N&#228;r juni kom satt man vid Sveav&#228;gen p&#229; Terrassen
Med flummiga visioner, if&#246;rd b&#228;sta hippiestassen
Vi lyssnade p&#229; Mecki Mark Men d&#229; och Fl&#228;sket Brinner
Och t&#228;nde p&#229; med allt med undantag av gas och thinner
Det tog sin tid att landa p&#229; sin r&#228;tta k&#246;l
Det gick med hj&#228;lp av Janov men det kr&#228;vdes mellan&#246;l

Sen gick jag runt och skrek p&#229; lek, jag tyckte synd om barnen
Vid dagis l&#229;g en motorled och hela grottekvarnen
Kr&#246;p innanf&#246;r mitt skinn och jag blev sjuk av polemiken
Jag f&#246;rdes &#229;ter till Maria-polikliniken
D&#228;r fick jag antabus, i n&#229;gra veckor stod jag pall
Jag rodnade s&#229; h&#228;ftigt n&#228;r jag fick ett &#229;terfall

Sen tog jag jobb p&#229; firma, det l&#229;g liksom i tiden
Att ha kavaj och slips och va besl&#246;jat v&#228;nstervriden
Men vi slog vakt om almarna n&#228;r snuten blev p&#229; hugget
En snut och jag var f&#246;rresten polare i plugget
Men stan jag dr&#246;mde om var fylld av fantasi och f&#228;rg
D&#228;r skulle fan f&#229; heta Hjalmar Mehr och Wallenberg

Och almarna st&#229;r kvar bevars men folk har tappat orken
Somliga f&#246;rsvann till skogs och somliga till torken
Andra sitter med familj och barn och h&#229;ller f&#228;rgen
I Farsta, Sk&#228;rmarbrink, H&#228;sselby och Hallonbergen
Med magkatarr och cancer &#8211; det tycks mej lite v&#228;l starkt
Att tvingas bo i den milj&#246;n och d&#246; i hj&#228;rtinfarkt

Med l&#246;nsamhet i blicken och med huvet under armen
Byggde dom ett d&#229;rhus och storstan miste charmen
Det vore kanske l&#228;ttare att g&#229; h&#228;r i ekluten
Om tjejerna fick komma in och riva upp besluten
F&#246;r jag &#228;r tr&#246;tt p&#229; luftslott och slimmad retorik
Och snack om servicehus och utbyggd kollektivtrafik

Men gubben kom och gubben gick med dokumentportf&#246;ljen
Och satte sej i lugn och ro i b&#228;sta skinnf&#229;t&#246;ljen
Vad bryr sej gubben om ifall det bl&#229;ser kallt som satan
P&#229; tjejerna som nu ska flytta till Regeringsgatan
Och han som lyfte kovan r&#246;rde aldrig vid n&#229;t knark
Han &#228;r en ansedd herre, han g&#229;r p&#229; s&#228;ker mark

Jag, jag log s&#229; hult och svalde tills jag ville m&#246;rda
Jag h&#246;rde till dom tigande, dom st&#228;ndigt &#246;verk&#246;rda
Jag tog min kniv och t&#228;nkte ""Inte sk&#228;ra, bara rispa""
Piketen kom och jag fick skjuts till f&#246;rsta b&#228;sta hispa
Jag slet och slog och sparkade och skrek som en f&#246;rryckt
Dom sa att jag var farlig fast jag bara var f&#246;rtryckt

Jag tydde mej till lodarna och sa ""Hej hopp, hur m&#229;r ni""
Och sj&#246;ng en s&#229;ng dom ans&#229;g var f&#246;r l&#229;ng och r&#228;tts&#229; corny
Jag sj&#246;ng p&#229; Mosebacke men responsen var s&#229; vissen
Att jag gick ut och svor och gr&#228;t p&#229; Katarinahissen
Jag t&#228;nkte hoppa n&#228;r det slog mej klart som i en bok
Att jag bara tagit r&#228;kning f&#246;r en taskig h&#246;gerkrok

Jag for som jojon mellan apatin och piedestalen
Mellan Hagaparkens lugna lunk och T-Centralen
Och b&#228;sta jag g&#229;r och m&#246;rkar, har jag hamnat mitt i sm&#246;ret
Sen var jag noll igen &#8211; sen gav jag fan i hela k&#246;ret
Ena veckan var det bara strul och strid och stress
Och n&#228;r man &#228;ntligen blev ensam dog man av tristess

S&#229; jag tog jordens ner&#229;ttjack och v&#228;cktes inte f&#246;rr&#228;n
Vintern, ja rent ut sagt fascismen stod f&#246;r d&#246;rren
Med hakkors, hat och heroin och st&#229;lar som var snabba
Och guden heter Mammon &#228;n och kungen heter Abba
Men s&#228;jer du ""Revolutionen sprack"", d&#229; har du fel
F&#246;r allt har sin s&#228;song och &#229;ngest &#228;r v&#229;r arvedel

Men detta k&#228;nner ni ju till, min b&#228;ste herr Kurator
Om ni vill veta mer om mej s&#229; kolla med n&#229;n dator
Jag sticker nu f&#246;r jag har slutat punda, sl&#229;ss och h&#228;rja
S&#229; m&#246;ter jag en man p&#229; v&#228;g fr&#229;n stan till Beckomberga
Jag fr&#229;gar ""Vem &#228;r ni som verkar s&#229; tr&#246;tt och vill""
Han svarar ""Birger Jarl"", jag s&#228;jer bara ""Lycka till""

On the corner a boy is waiting
The moonlight feels cold and desperate

Attention lives all over town
Ready to burst open into driving
Burning, exploding sound

If these walls could sing
They'd sing us a hundred songs
If these walls could talk
They'd say they've seen it coming all along

Tony's making slice pies for the lunch rush
Stirring the sauce, pounding out the dough
His brother left town with his girl
She ain't his girl no more

So mundane in this old town
Ready to burst open into driving
Burning, exploding sound

In our wasted years and days
Not stand in our way
That we may feel the winds of change

Lil' Flip
Represent
7-1-3

Now when you see me in the Lamborghini speeding, bumpin Screw
I know you see my license plate, ""Lil' Flip #2""
I use to skip summer school, hit the block and move work
That was enough to buy some shoes, pants, and a new shirt
Now I'm shinin like Puff, wearin diamonds like Puff
We got everybody else music sounding like US
So hold up! You better get your own style
'Cause we been bumpin Screw down here for a while!
And when you see me at the mall, Just me and my dawg
I'm shoppin' with them, 'Cause I ain't trickin for a broad
I do shows and rock crowds, And then I get paid
Summer time, I'm on dubs, Winter time, I'm on blades
My whole click livin' laid, man we all got Vets
My crib so big, I ain't even see my room yet
But hold up! You better get your own style
'Cause we been buyin six-figure homes for a while!
Now when you see me in the Vibe, Murder Dog and The Source
And the XXL, standing next to a Porsche
I get paid with my voice, so I pimp these beats
I hate commercial rap, so I pimp these streets
You don't work you don't eat, that's a known fact
I just don't rap, nigga I know how to act
But hold up! You better get your own style
'Cause we been fuckin' with magazines for a while!

Because we represent the 7-1-3!
The type of Rappers y'all never goin' be!
We makin' money y'all never goin' see!
Because we represent the 7-1-3!
Houston, Texas nigga!

Now when you see me with Tigga, On BET
Or 106 and Park, with AJ and Free
Or MTV, come take a look at my house
And after that, come take a look at my mouth
Yeah I represent the South, like Pastor Troy
And I'm still Fresh and Clean, like Andre and Big Boi
But hold up! You better get your own style
'Cause we been talkin' shit on TV for a while!
Now when you see me with a sweet, blowing smoke out my nose
9 times outta 10, I'm probably blowin' Hydro
So don't blow my high, just leave me alone!
'Cause I get high like Cheech and Chong
Call me 'Afroman' when my hair ain't braided
I got 20 tattoo's but I'm still educated
But hold up! You better get your own style
'Cause we been smokin' high-time weed for a while!
And when you see my at the club, I gotta get my floss on
Techno, my ring shinnin, and I got my cross on
I gotta brand new phone, 'Cause I'ma rich nigga
And when people call, you can see they picture
I'm still Lil'Flipper, but my money got taller
And my Benz got wider, and your hundred got smaller
But hold up! You better get your own style
'Cause we been acting bad, drivin' cars for a while!
When you see me Big Pimpin', like UGK
I'm choppin on blades, candy-paint, Jog Grey
I'm sittin' on Twenty's, but I'm twenty-one
I'm ridin' with an AK, you still got a B-B Gun
So you need to Back, Back, and gimme 50 feet
Cause you ain't sellin records like Sucka-Free
But hold up! You better get your own style
'Cause we been ridin' around with straps for a while!

Because we represent the 7-1-3!
The type of Rappers y'all never goin' be!
We makin' money y'all never goin' see!
Because we represent the 7-1-3!
Houston, Texas nigga!

37,"Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?

And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneakin' out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times

I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in

Oh oh oh
Oh God I, I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Goodbye

Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down

We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we'd know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel

Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when

Oh oh oh
Oh God I, I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it

I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it

If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it
It's time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Look at this photograph
Every time I do it makes me laugh
Every time I do it makes me

I'm 5 years old, and my dad's a giant sitting beside me
And the engine rattles my bum like berserk
While we're singing, 'Don't forget your shovel if you want to go to work!'

My dad's probably had a bloody hard day
But he's been good fun and bubbling and joking away
And the procession of cars stuck behind
Are getting all impatient and angry, but we don't mind

We're holding up the bypass, oh
Me and my dad having a top laugh, oh whoa

Sitting on the toolbox, oh
And I'm so glad I'm not in school, boss
So glad I'm not in school, oh no

And we pull over to let cars pass
And pull off again, speeding by the summer green grass
And we're like giants up here in our big yellow digger
Like zoids or transformers or maybe even bigger

And I want to transform into a Tyrannosaurus Rex
And eat up all the bullies and the teachers and their pets
And I'll tell all my mates, my dad's B.A. Barachus
Only with a JCB and Bruce Lee's nunchuckas

And we're holding up the bypass, oh
Me and my dad having a top laugh, oh whoa

Sitting on the toolbox, oh

Puoi chiamarmi partigiano, bandito oppure illuso
Soldato di una guerra persa prima del suo inizio

Sono la tua coscienza sporca, sono un vecchio contadino
Sono l'indio, il mendicante, sono l'ortica nel tuo giardino
I miei compagni sono gi&#224; morti o marciscono in prigione
Eppure sono ancora qui a gridare al mondo
""Viva la rivoluzione!""

Gli anni passano, i miti invecchiano, i muri son crollati
Le bandiere di una volta sono appese negli stadi
I giapponesi e i gringos arrivano a fare affari
E il paese ormai &#232; venduto alle multinazionali
Con quei dollari i generali organizzano la repressione
Eppure siamo ancora qui a gridare al mondo
""Viva la rivoluzione!""

Esta noche por la calle suena mi tambor
Con una taglia sulla testa tra i villagi sono andato
Molte case si sono aperte, molte volte si &#232; ricordato
Della leggenda da Paddy Garcia, di chi non smette di sognare
Nell'utopia della rivolta e non &#232; stanco di lottare
Per chi si unito c'&#232; la vittoria o il plotone d'esecuzione
Eppure siamo ancora qui a gridare al mondo
""Viva la rivoluzione!""

Esta noche por la calle suena mi tambor

Ora puoi chiamarmi Aureliano, Don Chisciotte o Pancho Villa
Ma sono un fuoco ancora acceso, sono l'urlo della gueriglia
Non combatto i mulini a vento e il nemico &#232; sul mio sentiero
Stasera offro un ballo davanti al mondo intero
Le campane danno il segnale, tutt'intorno c'&#232; confusione
Adesso posso urlare al mondo ""Per sempre che
Viva la rivoluzione!""

And said, ""I'd be yours if I had one of those.""

Behind your veil I found the body underneath
Inside your head were things I'd never thought about

If you apply some pressure!

What happens when you lose everything?
You just start again
You start all over again

I hope that I will live to see you undress
The everyday is part of what consumes me
The hate I feel is part of what fuels me

I testify to having guilty feelings
I must confess, I'd like to be caught stealing
You know that I would love to see you in that dress
I hope that I will live to see you undress

What's my view? Well, how am I supposed to know?

52,"Beware of what's around you.
The elements of life will sometimes take you in.
Bad things always surround you.
It's your choice now to think.
Crime is easy to come by and temptation is bound to bring you down.
Corruption distorts your judgement and it seems you can't trust no one now.
Thinking to myself there's a price to pay.
Is it worth the pain,
The pain of someone taking your life away?
Saying to myself there is a better way.
It's not worth the pain,
The pain of someone taking it all away.
Memories are here to remind you,
Learn from your brothers.
Don't make their mistakes.
Trouble will somehow find you,
It's your choice to contemplate.
Crime don't pay in the long run.
Money ain't worth the risk of death or jail.
I'm not judging no one.
I'm just thinking, talkin' to myself.

Though this is not her lord in case
The one who can't afford to face her image is restored to grace
Disappeared, no trace
Musky tear, suitcase
The downturn, brave little burn cub
Bear careless, turnip snare rampages
Pitch color pages
Down and out, but not in Vegas
Disembarks and disengages
No loft
Sweet pink canary cages
Plummet pop, dew skin, fortitude for the sniffing black noses
That snort and allude to dangling trinkets
That mimic the dirt cough go drink it's
It's for you

Blue battered naval down slip kisses
Delivered by duck muscles and bottle-nosed grifters
Arrive in time to catch the late show
It's a beehive barrel race
A she-hive stare and chase 
Wasted feature who tried and failed to reach her
Embossed beneath a box in the closet that's lost
The kind that you find when you mind your own business
Shiv sister to the quickness before it blisters
Into the new morning milk blanket
Your ilk is funny to the turnstyle touch bunny
Whose bouquet set a course for bloom without decay
Get your broom and sweep echoes of yesterday's fallen freckles away

Il dollaro saliva mentre Nixon sorrideva
E dalla guerra fredda un nuovo esercito cresceva
E vennero sceicchi insieme a ricchi colonnelli
Con capi di partito e giovani ribelli
Di colpo il terrorismo calava le sue ombre
E il mondo fu assordato dal rumore delle bombe

Da vecchi faccendieri con valigette in pelle

Since I handed you your final rose
In your house
I'm staring out the window at our tree
Heights of which
You'll never
Ever know

You always
Were there to rescue me
From December

In my minds eye
I see you next to me as I'm on my knees
It's in this place
That you showed me how to ask eternity
For shelter
For comfort
For relief

I see our branches stretching
To heights you'd not believe
One day these leaves will reach you
And there will be no more
Pain

You always gave me refuge
Unconditional
You always offered shelter
From December's snow
My chin still rests upon you
While my feet they sway
I wonder if you'll look the same
When you embrace me on that day

Glances round the table, eyes all shining, dark and bright
We meet again at daybreak for the day that will be ours
We're tomorrow's history
So just check your weapons, say your prayers.
Now the evening's over, voices muffled in the cold night mist
We leave the house together, home to rest up in the last few hours
Heads against the pillows with eyes that will not close
Of all the dreams that we've ever had
This is the one, this is the one
Now the night is over - dawn cracks open like a breaking shell
Now the waiting's over - as we walk in silence through the empty streets
We meet beneath the tower, greetings empty like the taste inside
Turn towards the valley and the day that has waited for us all our lives
Even in this age of concrete, even in this age of reason
There comes a time when you put your life
Into the hands of the gods.

Y no me canso de dibujarte con los dedos

Where it takes you about an hour just to cross the road
Just to stumble across another poor old soul
From the dreary old lanes to the high-street madness
I fight with my brain to believe my eyes
And it's harder than you think
To believe this sadness that creeps up my spine 
And haunts me through the night
Life is good, and the girls are gorgeous
Suddenly the air smells much greener now 
And I'm wandering around with a half pack of cigarettes
Searching for the change that I've lost somehow

These streets have too many names for me
I'm used to Glenfield Road and spending my time down in Orchy
I'll get used to this eventually
I know, I know

Where'd the days go when all we did was play?
And the stress that we were under wasn't stress at all
Just a run and a jump into a harmless fall
From walking by a high-rise to a landmark square
You see millions of people with millions of cares
And I struggle to the train to make my way home
I look at the people as they sit there alone
Life is good, and the sun is shining
Everybody floats to their ideal place
And the children all smile as a boat shuffled by them
Trying to pretend that they've got some space

These streets have too many names for me
I'm used to Glenfield Road and spending my time down in Orchy

All this space I'm taking up

Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state

Maybe you'll know when you see it
Maybe if you say it you'll mean it
And when you find it you keep it
In a permanent state

Where her lover's heart it did pound-O""

It came with a folded flag
It says right now I'm coming home
In a body bag

It's a pride and a pain that are one and the same
It's a burning cigarette, it's a horrible dream
There's a man in an office who's going through files
And a woman who watches TV

And she doesn't get the jokes 
Told by the late night talk show hosts
But for some reason she laughs anyway

There's this soap in my bathroom
And it's all covered in hairs
There's this hope in my brain
And it's all covered in prayers

There's a girl in this town who doesn't know I exist
There's a wounded sense of pride and a pain in my fist
There's twelve empty bottles on this table tonight
There's four lungs on fire and four burning eyes

And something will explode
And someone will cry
And someone will run out
And never turn around

There's a park in the city where I used to go
But now it's covered with fences and cops and light posts
And I'd never go back even if it was the same
But it kills me to know that it's changed

There's these kids who have dreams 
And there's these dreams that will grow
Until they get so goddamn big
That they explode

And what's left in the smoke and the falling debris
Is grownups like them and losers like me
And what's left in the smoke and the falling debris
Is grownups like them and losers like me

Grownups like them and losers like me
Grownups like them and losers like me

Makin' NBA players start to think, who's that standin' over there
Takin' pictures for Rolling Stone magazine with a leash on a polar bear
Sky blue suit from Milan, girls posin their executive area
Acting like they don't see me, standin in front of me
Walkin' by me three or four times
Showin me views of they Victoria Secret thongs, tryin' to turn me on
Eyewitness news interrupt the Shane Mosley fight
Just to pan in closer to my shoes
Televised, myself beyond cellular phones and business cards, I network
Make the Billboard, number one singers and rappers
People from RCA, Clive Davis net-hurt

Save 'em (save 'em)

Cover my face with Rayban glasses, from photographers I try to hide
Ladies with lingerie cry, 'cause I wear protection won't come inside
Places get empty when I leave
Pay butlers 600 dollars a minute just to adjust my cufflinks, and my shirtsleave
In 2003, in the double R, I lean metallic green
Professional chauffeurs over my doors
Women lust over my lyrics like basketball players
NFL teams walk up unbenouced
Excuse me! I'm talkin' to Tristar Pictures right now
Keyshawn Johnson I heard you a great football star
I'm not plastic, but I'm on a conference call
Talking to Michelle Phieffer and Ben Barene
Go down stairs to the movie theaters
Me and my old lady like the persuaders
Morrie alligators, 800 combination flavors
Countin' presidents, we stand with cash mil's, like the Miz

Jacuzzi bathtub, with a 24-second clock to take your panties down
If not most girls get replaced by a sub
Sent home, upscale in a limosine with a Subway sandwich and a dub
Erased from the system
I move better, collared shirt made of leather
Why would you be walking around Beverley Hills wearin pleather?
With lights, camera, action
A part of my MCing is a small fraction
Strong machines coming on Greyhound from Memphis
Girls screamin at the Captain, ""I wanna be saved!""

Blastin the mad streets and merkin
Shot at strangers from out the Ranges and Suburbans
Curtains for anybody perpin
Leave in a hearse for certain
Blood on the curb and bandages like turbans
We roll a durbin
All in this dirt, puffin the herb an'
We bring the verbs in
Double action's loaded with Germans
Area's urban, block's hot where we be swervin
Gun fights strike like a serpent
People nerves jerkin
Lay down any person
Strictly for just talkin' rehearsin
The skills remain tight as Holy Mary the Virgin
Slowly carry the burden
So we varied the shit you heard an'
Hit you with the different methods and versions;
We simply,
Let bullets rip until the clip is empty
Get laid in your tracks as if you was ??
Hit you like Jack Dempsey
The mac packin MC, with gats clappin like an M.P.
Over your friendly wimpy, frame like an M.D.
Blow you until your block's windy
Be on short of a shot frenzy
My glocks don't stop till the cops hem me
Blow holy hollow tops in me
Hazardous shit - guns is accurate
Sendin niggaz to meet the King of Nazareth
Playin' me close has a risk
I bash clicks like they was massacres
Blast the tear gas, thinkin' I'm pacifist
That's the fifth, one last kiss before your ash is missed
These bastards is gettin' clapped by the strap at the wrist

Chorus: Kool G. Rap (repeat 2X)

Yo let the games begin
The tec and mac-10 flames begin
Thugs to the end, my whole crew insane with sins
Hammers to firing pins
Me and my kin be makin' you spin
The Lord or The Devil takin' you in

(Kool G. Rap)
It's the Corona Queens apocalypse
My block is hit with the dark eclipse
Takin' no hostages, so grab the glocks and clips
The rap's apostle-ist, niggaz to Loch Ness
Large as Colossus is
Mumblin shit get shot at the esophagus
A Thug Saga novelist
Sex in this rap shit monogamous
Rainin like the drop is while you be topicless
Blow money monopolist - do it for eons
Shinin like it's, neon - heart colder than freon
Decidin which MC to pee on;
Baby cause that's the shit that we on
Niggaz go to Warrick like Deion
Put the G on
I analyze guys with Montana eyes
To vandalize any man alive, soon as the hammer rise
Cut 'em down like samurais
Kickin that real shit that you fantasize
Niggaz step aside or recognize
G. the real cat, pack the steel cat, baby feel that
Leave you layin flat witcha shit clapped and peeled back
Battle-actin' rap shit'll put you in back of a Cadillac
A bad decision; fuck up your whole vision like cataracts
Red roses on a dead foe
Layin in wet clothes from head blows
Your whole brain be exposed
Get your body torn out the frame from lead throws
None of my victims ever bled slow
Stiff as Edgar Poe, that's how it go

Tra I padri di famiglia coi loro bot e le loro Mercedes
Timorati di Dio e delle tasse, elettori di Craxi e dei suoi
Spaventati di perdere tutto se qualcuno li avesse sorpresi

&#200; continuato a Pontida in un grido di rabbia e paura
Di geometri con lo spadone, di dentisti con l'armatura
Decisi a difendere il Patrol e la villetta sulla tangenziale
Le nigeriane sui viali e la loro evasione fiscale

Hey-oh stanno arrivando armati di spranghe e luoghi comuni
Non lasceranno che niente cambi, c'&#232; un giro di vite in arrivo

Eh-oh attento alle spalle a dove e con chi vai in giro la sera
A quello che dici ai sogni che fai
C'&#232; un giro di vite in arrivo

E adesso &#232; come un'onda, un'onda nera e appiccicosa
Che cola dalle TV e dai settimanali rosa
Che uccide I nostri pensieri, che ci droga di calcio e sesso
E intanto chi tira le fila insabbia e corrompe e non ha mai smesso

E quindi devi decidere cos'hai intenzione di fare
Rimanere in riva al Lough Derg a vedere le fate danzare
Oppure seguirmi a Carlow e andare incontro al nostro destino
Una guerra che non si pu&#242; vincere e una stella a guidare il cammino

Hey-oh fai la tua scelta

I was now dreaming all the time.
Dark sounds and images were haunting me, unsettling me.
There were many things from my past.

Most of what I saw and heard I didn't understand.
But they were not only dreams, they were somehow more real...
I felt followed.
Again I had fallen asleep with my headphones on.

The doorbell. It pulled me from my dreams.
I dragged myself to the door.
Someone had left a tape on the doorstep.

In my head.
In my head.
I can feel them,
In my head.

Chop suie got a buck knife in his hand
Finishing the shit that them suckas started
They shoulda ar'a, knew that I'm coming harder
Fully are a, shot the whole lot up
Niggas trying cut quick, cramped up in a knot
I'm a rida, cutthoat general
In 84' I said fuck it, I'm in it now
I'm killing now, letting Mothafuckas know
I'm a pimp quit acting like a fucking ho
You ain't know, bitch niggas get played
Razor sharp game, cut you like a switch blade
Its Dre waking up yo family
15 cudie in your drive way, they can't stand me
Paint candy licking like a blow pop
I'm so flamie, nigga it don't stop

Fuck driving, let me out when I slide threw
I drop love, like souls in a ten booth
Fucking wit yo huctes mento
Like I'm kend to her
But I'm just a die hard pimp girl
Into a nickname kosie, or call me B.A.
I'll send two huctes with yo wife right with me
I know, they say I'm crazy but I only drink white
Unless I'm with a snow bunny
So let's get the remy, get the bevi, act stupid
I'll slide through in a fly coup with two cute ones
Keak dat Sneak, plus Mac Dre be the homie
I'll be damn if the hutches think they got something on me
Ho its real, my life is ill
We send 'em see what's I'm and get inside their grill

Still highly national, still a killa wit murder flow
Still screaming all in the do
Bet yo ass down fo, 'cause that's the trade mark
Where nothing but brave hearts, thug relutional
Never thought when a muthafucka losing crutal
Collect the doe, thinking ah and still counting it
Smoking by the pound you niggas still quarter ouncing it
Dry cut let it melt down bouncing it
Nine hundred thousand fo my kids allowance
I'm drunk as fuck so I hit the loaf and bouncing it
Still gifted talented, from a notch to a bad bitch
Get mo then yo ass kicked depend on how mad I get
Genet razor dagger shit I'm leaving faces like naxima attics bitch
I'm from mind over money and murder would manage shit
Without a sign, hearding some endings

Check me out, check me out

(Verse 1: Lil' Flip)
I came in the door (door), I told y'all before (fore)
I never fall in love wit a motherfucking hoe (hoe)
I keep it pimpin' like Good Game, I'm still in the hood man
Drinkin' my purple stuff and grippin my wood grain (my wood grain)
I got hoes in area codes like Ludacris (Ludacris)
You think I'm trickin my dough - that's some stupid shit
I got a plan to be a man 'cause I sell bricks
So you can let that other nigga get your nails fixed
I treat a bitch like a bitch, a lady like a queen
Spit my game, get in her brain, now she on my team
And after we done I might call you later (might)
Just holla at a player (yeah)

(Chorus: Butch Cassidy) + (Lil' Flip)
Cause you neva know, you neva know... when somebody might be fuckin' your bitch
Cause you neva know, you neva know... when somebody might be fuckin' your bitch
U neva know, and you neva know... when somebody might be fuckin' your bitch
Cause you neva know, cause you neva know
(Yeah, cause it might just be)
(Look, a nigga like me)

(Verse 2: Lil' Flip)

Just call me when you get off work cause right now I'm busy (I'm busy)
And when I finished what I'm doin', we can kick it (ah)
I know ya nigga be goin' through your phone (uh huh)
But it's cool cause every night I been roamin in this home (ha)
That nigga lame 'cause he don't even smoke wit you
Take trips on the boat wit you, kick back and show wit you

(Chorus: Butch Cassidy) + (Lil' Flip) - (w/ minor variations)

(Verse 3: Lil' Flip)
Now you can roll (you can roll) but you know we kick it all night (all night)
Cause your friends is my friends, ain't that all right (all right)
Now look (look), I got a flight to make
And I can't be runnin' late 'cause I'm about that cake
I got business in H2's (what else?), yachts and boats (what else?)
I got crocodile shoes, leather minks and coats
I'm still livin' the hood life, but I'm livin' the good life
So don't get mad 'cause I'm bangin' ya wife (nigga!)
You like to make love (make love) but she want it rough (she want it rough)
You need to talk to her (talk to her) 'cause she had enough (she had enough)
You think you got it locked (you got it locked) but I got the key
'Cause I'm a motherfucking P-I-M-P

(Verse 4: Butch Cassidy)
You never know, these undercover hoes
Is fallin', you got to stay on your toes
They plottin schemes, or better they chasin dreams
But no, these hoes ain't movin me (meeee!)

Well I'm just going to try my luck (hoo hoo)
They end up sick and hurt, but leavin' in a skirt
Then find some better love to fuck (ah)

Sittin' in an old house trippin' on rock &amp; roll

You were
A pretty little girl who never listened to what you were told

Maybe someday
You and I will be together

You and I will find forever
Maybe baby, maybe baby can't live without you
Why? I just don't know
But for now I've got to

Sittin' over there messin with your blonde hair but it's alright

Falling from the sky
Down, down, down, pouring down
Upon the night
Well there's just one chance in a million
That someday we'll make it out alive

Rain, rain, rain, an evil rain
Falling all the time
Sun, sun, sun
Sun don't ever want to shine
Well there'll be no light in the morning
Till some peace at last we find

Like travellers in the darkness
Can't see our way
Trying hard to make it through
Another day

Father, father, father
Why do you let your sons go astray
Brother, brother, brother
Why must we go on this way
There's a storm off in the distance
And it looks like it's here to stay

Rain, rain, rain

109,"A toast to love with paper cups
And a vow to never part
They're saying to each other there's a fire burning
Deep within their hearts
But at her darkest hour he's gone far away
She's all alone
And when the lights go out it's the hardest time
The hardest time to be alone

She sends her Mary off to school
And sits to watch TV
They're talking about spending their lives together
The way it's supposed to be
Then the baby cries, wakes her from her dream
She's on her own
And when the lights go out it's the hardest time
The hardest time to be alone

A mother's dream is like a story never told
Reaching out for something more then a hand to hold
Wanting the girl she left behind
So far behind

Pen and paper in her hand
To write the folks back home
She's telling them again that her life is better
Not like long ago
Then her shaking hand tears across the page
Crumbles to the floor
And when the lights go out it's the hardest time
The hardest time to be alone

I'll never feel that way again

You took something away from me

Oh I wanted to grow old by your side

Can't I keep You
You just went away
Why can't I keep you
The rest is silence
Why can't I keep you
You just went away
And The rest is silence

I see it was right to separate and stop these fights
It seems that my dreams weren't meant to be
To talk to you still feels like coming home
Oh I wanted to grow old by your side

Can't I keep you
You just went away
Why can't I keep you
The rest is silence
Why can't I keep you
You just went away
And the rest is silence

Sometimes I think we might have lived too long together
But sometimes I wonder if we'd have made it if we'd just tried a little longer
Can't I keep you
You just went away
Why can't I keep you
The rest is silence
Why can't I keep you
You just went away

I cannot wait to see you again
To see you from behind the scenes
Makeup gone beneath the sheets
My most precious little bee
Ivory skin... so sugar sweet

It's getting dark in here
With you my closest friend
It's getting dark again
I'll stay with you until dawn sets in

Curled up in a soft cocoon
Flowers laced with your perfume
To see you in the warm moonlight
Blankets wrapping us so tight
How I've missed this lovely sight
As I lay here with you tonight

Cannot wait to see you soon
Snowflakes fall and flowers bloom
Elastic words tend to blind my eyes
Shadow creatures in disguise
The things you say
Saving kisses for another day
All we have to do left in the dark
Is laugh the night away
Away...

With bright smiles and dark eyes

Everywhere I went, oh
I was always looking for ya
Bright smile dark eyes

I'm looking for some peace
But it's so hard to find
With Calamity Janes and the Steamboat Casanovas

Just pin your heartbeat up against my heartbeat
And you'll see how well we rhyme

Everything has felt so meaningless and vain
That I've lost the will to live

Ripped my heart right out and since you went away

Across the dark, into the light
May death again us unite

Love, my fate
Will you wait for me there... where our autumn dawns?
There, beyond the dreary seas

Will you wait?
Will you welcome me into your arms once more?
Where our waters still fall free

Cross my heart and hope to die
May my end come tonight
Across the dark, into the light
May death again us unite

Cross my heart and hope to die
May my end come tonight

May death again us unite

At your funeral I was buried, too
My life ... it ended with yours

I ain't bringing my style, I ain't bringing my skills
But I got the skills, to pay my whole click bills
Now what's the deal punk, you got beef let me know
1 Da Boy kicking in your front, and your back do'
I ain't no punk mark, bitch, hater or a hoe
If you aggravate my mind, your head slammed to the flo'
'Cause I'm a hard hitting thug, that's about my scrill
Always scheming in my brain, how to make a quick mill
Now what's the deal, I'm keeping it low but real steel
1 Da Boy on top, of the world now do you feel
The hits that I spit, on this track support shit
Avarice taking over, ain't no and, if's or misses

Quien no busca puerta no hallara la entrada

A veces resulta incuficiente la voluntad
Si de otro depende la realidad, por eso entiendo
Y explicaselo al corazon, que solo aprende
El que arriesga su razon

El que nada intenta nunca hara camino
Nuestras decisiones van creando sestino
Asi fue conmigo

Eterna amargura la que nos deja el amor que no madura
Que malo sabe el dolor

Ya se va, me deja en la soledad, sufriendo

Se va perdiendo la fe, quedas diciendo, amor pa que
Buscando el consuelo en el licor
Recordando lo que el tiempo se llevo

Sobre la ausencia
Queda el recuerdo
Y la sentencia
Del sufrimiento

Oye hermano, es que la vida es asi
Y hasta un lobo puede morir de amor

Me embarca y se aleja, me olvida y me deja
Como a sinbad el marino, en el mar de la ansiedad

Dentro de la carcel de la memoria voy repitiendo
La historia que me condena en la eternidad

Tristeza llega, me abraza y me aprieta y no se despega
Y no me deja contrar la felicidad

Ya no estas mas a mi lado corazon, en el alma solo siento soledad

I know this chick, yo mami is rich, she push a six
Living some bloodshed, her man is pushing bricks
Crib way out in the sticks, they house looking slick
It's like some shit straight out of a Hollywood flick
Me and my clique met the chick up at Saint Nicks
Honey was thick, I was the first nigga to kick
Yo mami was thick, silk skirt with thigh split
I couldn't quit, trying to peep out the privates
The live shit, you know how loose I get
I'm scheming on her back, peeping her hips, fiending to hit
Plump cherry lips, medium tits, Chink eyes her baby hair chick
The type you want to pair with, have an affair with
We chattered a bit, slipped me the digits, to the hip and the phone flip
Said she had to split, hopped in the whip, headed up the strip
Probably had to get with her man and shit
Later on at night, I'm stressing love at first sight
Some ain't right, I ain't the type of cat like me
To be dealing with mad feelings
And even though mami was mad appealing
Body revealing and big wheeling
This shit is illin, I don't like it
Fuck it, I can't fight it
I reaching for the cordless to call Miss
I insist to get with this
Tan Tone answer the phone, ""Hello, who this?"" (chick)
""It's me baby, G Luciano, what up lady""
""Fine and how you doing boo"" (chick)
""Ain't nothing new but you, angel, yo why don't you swing through
""We could sip on some champagne from Spain boo""
About an hour or two she came through, fly hairdo
We link, push in the six circle circle drink
To purple mink, had mad bank, Chanel bag full of Benjamin Franks
More ices than a hockey rink, face of a Saint
Went for a drink ? Hot shots
Would wanna spend those five digit o's, on bimbo's
Bar closed, back to her six double o, she drove
My eyes closed her nigga dozed, when I awoke
Saw mad snow, we at her spot at the Poconos
Bridge robes, crib hot as a stove
She changed out of her clothes, put on a silky bath robe
Panty hoes with see through holes, pretty toes
Took me into the master suite, shit was sweet
Jacuzzi four feet deep, with satin sheets
As I was speaking to this half black/latin freak
Met on a Manhatten street, body petite, fat on the cheeks
I was getting open, started laughing and joking
We weed smoking, stroking, the shorty's spoke and
Said what the deal is, the realness
My man is crazy as Bruce Willis
If he catches us, he'll try to kill us
He got a whole army of Kiiers
Me no worry, I got the clapper son
End of the first verse, chapter one
Word
Shit is real in the field
Thug love story

(G. Luciano)
So here I am
Laid up in this lavish house, up in the Poconos
With this chick I don't even really know
Steady stressing me how ill her man is
So what I go and do, heh-heh, I nail her ass to the bed anyway
Straight twisting mami's back out
Hit three o'clock, fell right the fuck to sleep
Clothes still on, breath smelling like Henrock
Totally no kind of regards for this bitch's man
I guess it's just another one of those G Rap adventures


(Kool G. Rap)
The next day about a quarter to eight
I heard a squeek on the staircase
Got the gat from under the pillow case
Somebody broke in, now me and boo fully awoken
Good thing I slept inside my clothes and shorty was frozen
I'm waiting for a head to poke in, and start smoking
The home invasion, right through the door, he started blazing
Bullets was grazing, shit was crazy and
I had to think to fast, let the gun blast, duck, then dash
Heard a crash, they broke through the door, they on her ass
Jumped off the balcony like a falcon Gee
With honey right in back of me, feel on top of the snow in agony
Shit was thick, couldn't get to the six, they loaded the fifth
Saw the snowmobile yo fuck it
We start jumped it, get on top of the shit and peeled
Mad soldiers out in the field, busting they steel
The raw deal, kill or be killed, shit is real
Ten hit me right on my heels, trying to make a thugs blood spill
In zero degrees, niggas on skis, me and these Gees
Slipping through pine trees, we skid up behind these
Two big rocks and left off shots, about four dropped
The other six started to pop, I feel something hot
I think I got hit, my jacket is ripped
Loaded my last clip then broke out quick and checked the chick
She on my back tighter than shit, like vise grips
I started clapping, niggas rolled up in blowing black and
Spotted this Rover by a log cabin, we got our as in
Mash the gas, make the fucking wheel spin
The safety again, and still doing a hundred and ten
Shorty shivering, lips quivering, ski suits up in the back seat
Pulled over the Jeep get it in
And took a rest stop at the river bend
We living, we made it the fuck out, mad slugs delivering
Pretty soon we at my rest piece, up in the bedroom
Got shorty boo tending my bullet wound
Put on some tunes, she blew my shit like a balloon
Up in the moonlit room, and dicking her womb
Hitting full behind her, grinding her with my anaconda
She rode the dick like a honda
I took her to the point of no return like Bridgette Fonda
She back spasmed, giving the crazy orgasm, from steady rhythm
My dick glistened, her lips hit'em, I shot jism
Then laid back in the sack and lit the ism
I thought about the realism
Niggas coming and bring they steel with them
I got just the thing to deal with them
Nickel plate Mac, the laser attached, with two clips packed
Push a niggas whole head back, so I snatched that
So quick spread out and play the layout
Still on alert, me and the skirt, day in and day out


(G. Luciano)
Yo what's the matter mami, you scared or something?

(Mami)
I'm a little worried baby

(G. Luciano)
Yo, don't be worried about nothing, all right
Everything is gonna be all right

(Mami)
OK

(G. Luciano)
Look, we just gonna go to your house, go get the money
You know, we gonna get your backs or whatever
And we gonna get out of there, all right?

(Mami)
All right, ven paca papi, dame un besito

(G. Luciano)
All right, grab that bag money

(Mami)
Let's do this, baby


(Kool G. Rap)
After three whole days of lamping, we broke camp and
Went out to the beach, many mansions out in the Hamptons
Brung the clamp, ready to shoot shit up at random
Five hundred grand is buried in the sand
We planning, up in the crib-o with big windows, I'm counting the dough
She packing her clothes, had her Lexus in the back of the Rolls
I saw the keys, I grabbed the G's, we on and took those
Shit was sitting on some chrome momo's
Tinted windows, a LS Ford double O
Told the chick, yo you moving to slow
Speed it up baby, we got to go
And get this plane and hit the Caymans
With the payment, somebody came in
A platoon of goons with heaters aiming
I drew the Mac 10 and started flaming, they did the same and
Slugs spraying and blood raining, I left about seven thugs laying
But this one cat was gaining, he grab the dame and
Put the heater to the chicks brain and
I let my two guns drop, they got the drop
They took us both to a boat dock, then on a yacht
The chick's man was there with a sixteen shot
Nigga was hot, took the glock and hit me dead in my knot
Honey started to panic and yelling that money in Spanish
Thinking he's out to take advantage
So we're out in the fucking Atlantic
With no lifesavers and stranded
Backhanded the chick on the floor, called her a whore
Said, ""amor you won't be pretty no more""
Took us on a tour, down in the deck
Guess he wasn't ready to kill us yet
Saw this nigga there, holding the Tec
Ready to wet, I'm started to sweat, a niggas stressed
We up beside a horrible mess
I saw a box with the letters on it S.O.S
So I took out a flare gun and shot the kid in the chest
Took the Tec from out his hand, now I'm ready to bless
The madness, put the rest of them niggas to rest
Looked around, the chick's man was the only one left
Threw his ass over board and told him hold your breath
Caught my breath, I seen honey down on the deck
Eyes closed with a bullet hole dead in her breast
Held her in my arms till her soul finally left
I'm mad depressed, my baby was an innocent death
A real thug lost the only women he loved
And I bugged, busting slugs at the stars above

142,"We are two mariners
Our ships' sole survivors
In this belly of a whale

Its ribs our ceiling beams, 
Its guts our carpeting,
I guess we have some time to kill 

You may not remember me, 
I was a child of three 
And you a lad of eighteen 

But I remember you, 
And I will relate to you 
How our histories interweave
 
At the time you were a rake and a roustabout
Spending all your money on the whores and hounds
Oh, oh

You had a charming air 
All cheap and debonair 
My widowed mother found so sweet 

And so she took you in, 
Her sheets still warm with him, 
Now filled with filth and foul disease 

As time wore on you proved a debt-ridden drunken mess 
Leaving my mother a poor consumptive wretch
Oh, oh

And then you disappeared, 
Your gambling arrears
The only thing you left behind 

And then the magistrate 
Reclaimed our small estate 
And my poor mother lost her mind 

Then one day in spring my dear, sweet mother died 
But before she did I took her hand as she, dying, cried:
Oh, oh
 
""Find him, bind him, tie him to a pole and break his
Fingers to splinters; drag him to a hole until he
Wakes up naked clawing at the ceiling of his grave""

It took me fifteen years 
To swallow all my tears
Among the urchins in the street  

Until a priory 
Took pity and hired me 
To keep their vestry nice and neat 

But never once in the employ of these holy men 
Did I ever once turn my mind from the thought of revenge
Oh, oh

One night I overheard 
The prior exchanging words 
With a penitent whaler from the sea 

The captain of his ship 
Who matched you toe to tip 
Was known for wanton cruelty 

The following day I shipped to sea with a privateer
And in the whistle of the wind I could almost hear:
Oh, oh

""Find him, bind him, tie him to a pole and break his
Fingers to splinters; drag him to a hole until he
Wakes up naked clawing at the ceiling of his grave

""There is one thing I must say to you
As you sail across the sea 
Always your mother will watch over you
As you avenge this wicked deed""

And then that fateful night 
We had you in our sight
After twenty months at sea

Your starboard flank abeam, 
I was getting my muskets clean 
When came this rumbling from beneath 

The ocean shook, the sky went black, and the captain quailed
And before us grew the angry jaws of a giant whale
Oh, oh <i>[screaming]</i>
Oh <i>[screaming]</i>

Don't know how I survived 
The crew all was chewed alive 
I must have slipped between its teeth

But, O! what Providence! 
What divine intelligence! 
That you should survive as well as me

It gives my heart great joy to see your eyes fill with fear 
So lean in close and I will whisper the last words you'll hear
Oh, oh

Cuando la noche presenta sus signos
c&#243;mo quisiera tener claridad
a veces pienso que toda una vida
no es suficiente para ser impecable

Son estos muertos que traigo cargando
los que me obligan a perderme en la noche

Son estos huesos que siguen brillando
los que se llevan la memoria de los d&#237;as

Son estas voces que sigo escuchando
las que me obligan a buscarte en otra vida

They never loved their fellow man

Caught him at his last breath
These walls built to stand come-what-may
Lie shattered in the ashes
His skin against this dirty floor
Eyes fixed on the ceiling
He has stretched those chains of sin
Far beyond all feelings
Still, so still

In his head a thunderous
Cry of desperation
Tearing voices from his past
Scream for his attention
Behind those eyes a world explodes
No one there to save him
All pain that he's been passing on
Answers to his craving
Once more

I will never leave this shame

Falling far beyond the point of no return
Nothing to become and nothing left to burn

Stealing meaning from this child
We took away his reason
His soul put under lock and key
His heart blackened from treason
But if you take from those you fear
Everything they value
You have bred the perfect beast
Drained enough to kill you

Falling far beyond the point of no return
Nothing to become and nothing left to burn

Unseen
Untouched
Bleeding
Empty
Exposed
Dying
Eyes closed

Once he had forests and mountains
That were only his, listening to him
Once he would run through the summer days
Catching memories for ages to come
Now he is dressing this naked floor
With his flesh and blood, and times passes by
His trade of pain might just have lead him
To deal with consequence
For some change as time passes by

Craving, clawing, hurting, falling down)

(Of an eyeless storm, of fallen gods
Who lost their way)

To breed the Perfect Element

Will I ever walk again?

Falling far beyond the point of no return
Nothing to become and nothing left to burn

City nights are so exciting
Nothing gonna slow me down
Hold on tight, I love that sound

Hi way, skyway, seven kinds of my way
Fast cars, porn stars
Yeah it's been a wild ride

Hey yeah hey yeah hey yeah
Wanna go for a ride

Hey little girl
Come and rock my world
Take you for a twirl
On my crazy motorcycle

Hear the angels screaming baby
No sweet words are gonna save me
Kick it into overdrive
Feels so good to be alive

Across the bay on a clear day
And I can watch the boats come in and set their anchors
And my folks are away at the store
So I don't have to listen to anyone say anything.
And I swim out as far as I can
And float on my back
Just waiting for nothing.
I hope they never come back to this house.
It's a lot more fun alone.
I can do anything I want
And so I'm swimming
More like floating
And I'll just stay out here
Until the night comes crashing down
And I swim out as far as I can
And float on my back
Just waiting for nothing.
They always come home
At the wrong time
Like when I'm all right
And don't need no one at all.

To find you in the bedroom not breathing at all
I drag your body to the cellar where we lay, the wax it melts away,
I kiss your face...

Now we are starting to love you more
Your body's on the canvas I painted on the floor

Now you wait, like the drug, like the change in the pain it goes on for so long
And oh, how it hurts in the worst way, now that you're gone, it's so wrong, it's so wrong...

If I could take you somewhere, I'd take you to the darkest place,
Scatter you in art forms, admire the whore
Beauty in different ways, your hands on picture frames
Your eyes in the glass wear your face as a mask

Now they are starting to love you more
A gallery of your beauty, no charge at the door

As you wait, like the drug, like the change in the pain it goes on for so long
And oh, how it hurts in the worst way, now that you're gone, it's so wrong, it's so wrong...

And down below your veins run dry your vacant eyes
I lost control your face is pale, your body's cold
And down below your veins run dry your vacant eyes
I lost control your face is pale, your body's cold

Wait, like the drug, like the change in the pain it goes on for so long
And oh, how it hurts in the worst way, now that you're gone, it's so wrong, it's so wrong...

I saw esteem's corpse
Deafened by allure's sweet, sweet song

Affixed like I'm under a spell (1x darling)

That starts today
It seems just yesterday I ate it up
Your yarns were dipped in gold
I swallowed them whole
The real tragedy is that your act is just boring and old
Back and forth with this disdain (1x darling)
That ain't even why I came (2x darling)

You want me crawling on my knees

Fist pounding on a vending machine
Toy diamond ring stuck on her finger

With a noose she can hang from the sun
Put it out with her dark sunglasses
Walking crooked down the beach
She spits on the sand where their bones are bleaching

And I know I'm gonna steal her life
She doesn't even know what's wrong
And I know I'm gonna make her die
Take her where her soul belongs
And I know I'm gonna steal her life

And her rags were burning
Crawling out from a land filled life 
Scrawling her name upon the ceiling

Throw a coin in a fountain of dust
White noise, her ears are ringing
Got a ticket for a midnight hanging
Throw a bullet from a freight train leaving

And I know I'm gonna steal her life

We'll dance from here to nowhere

Believing none, we pray;
It wasn't meant to be this way
Shattered looking glass
Makes such a pretty scratch...

I hide behind the others,
Where the sun don't shine,
But can you see the looking out...

Growing up trying to find the sun?
Growing up trying to find the light within...

Inside our army the petals fall
Stems cut off, attached to nothing at all
Shattered looking glass
Makes such a pretty scratch...

Weil sein Gewissen schrie
Da gab es nur ein Mittel
Und sie brachen ihm die Knie

Was steckte man dies' Haus an?
Verbrannte Menschen am lebendigen Leib?

Oder irgendeine andere Nichtigkeit

Was pfercht man diese Menschen in Lager?
Und gibt ihnen einen s&#252;&#223;lichen Geruch?
Solange sie leben, graben sie in der Erde
Zum Sterben ist noch Zeit genug
Wer gibt da die Befehle?

Obscure the view in front of you

Embrace that white oblivion

The use of force, he was so tough

He has laughed and he has cried
He has fought and he has died
He's just the same as all the rest

The babbling that I brook

Why you wasn't there to hug me and watch me grow
Daddy do you love me and if so
Why you wasn't there to hug me and watch me grow
This is what it sound like
Growing up without your godfather in your life

Young black male growing up without a father figure
Ha ha ha, makes it that much harder nigga
Trying to be a man with no example of a man
Mama doing what she can but she can't show you how to be a man
And this is where we break down
We used to be cops and robbers, turn into shake down
Now we living like rebels, born killers
We born to be kings and queens nigga, on the reala
I know that you and your baby mama can't get along
But there's no excuse, so leave the kid alone
Cause ain't nothing like the birth of a child
A blessing in disguise, the girls, the guys with they daddy's eyes
And think about this before you abandon them
The people they try and can't even having one
Before you say I'm preaching and you don't wan' hear it
Take a look in the mirror, can you feel it

Daddy do you love me and if so
Why you wasn't there to hug me and watch me grow
Daddy do you love me and if so
Why you wasn't there to hug me and watch me grow
Daddy do you love me and if so
Why you wasn't there to hug me and watch me grow
This is what it sound like
Growing up without your godfather in your life
Daddy do you love me and if so
Why you wasn't there to hug me and watch me grow
Daddy do you love me and if so
Why you wasn't there to hug me and watch me grow

Hussling in these peoples game

Proud enough for you to call me arrogant
Greedy enough to be labeled a thief
Angry enough for me to go and hurt a man
Cruel enough for me to feel no grief

Never could have just a part of it
I always need more to get by 
Getting right down to the heart of it
The root of all evil has been running my whole life

Dirty enough for me to lust
Leaving nothing left to trust
Jealous enough to still feel envious
Lazy enough to sleep all day
And let my life just waste away
Selfish enough to make you wait for me

Driven blindly by our sins
Misled so easily
Entirely ready to leave it behind
I'm begging to break free

Take all of me
The desires that keep burning deep inside
Cast them all away
And help to give me strength to face another day
I am ready
Help me be what I can be

<b>VII. Remove</b>

Self-centered fear has got a hold of me
Clutching my throat
Self righteous anger running all through me
Ready to explode

Procrastination paralyzing me
Wanting me dead
These obsessions that keep haunting me
Won't leave my head

Help to do for me what I can't do myself
Take this fear and pain
I can't break out of this prison all alone
Help me break these chains

Humility now my only hope
Won't you take all of me
Heal this dying soul

I can feel my body breaking
I can feel my body breaking
I'm ready to let it all go
I can feel my body shaking
Right down to the foundation
The root of it all

Take all of me
The desires that keep burning deep inside
Cast it all away
And help to give me strength to face another day
I am ready
Help me be what I can be
I am ready
Come to me
Take me away

Black of the cold must come in by midnight

You got to get away because were here to stay

Definitely not by email

That look familiar in a high school way
We gotta get away
They get up on us too
Sirens screaming red and blue
Lonely streetlights that don't love my name
Looks burning, we get off on it

mi posava alla fine del mondo tra isole e terre lontane.
Camminavo al tuo fianco sul molo guardavamo le barche passare,
mi cantavi una musica dolce pi&#249; dolce del canto del mare.

L'orchestra suonava ""The blackbird"" nel bar sulla strada del porto,
i pescatori gridavano forte fra il vino, la birra e le carte.
Raccontavi le storie di viaggi, di strade, di amici caduti,
di amori incontrati lontano e di amori che il tempo ha perduto.

E i giorni correvano e il tempo nel sogno volava,
stringevo la donna delle isole, ballavamo leggeri nell'aria.
E i giorni passavano e l'oceano li stava a cullare
e il vento alla fine del mondo portava un canto del mare.
Seduti fra pietre e brughiere guardavamo i gabbiani volare
Raccontavi la storia del bimbo che un giorno scapp&#242; con le fate
Ma il vento dell'ovest chiamava ed il cielo d'Irlanda svaniva,
mi svegliai in una stanza deserta ubriaco mentre il sogno finiva.

E i giorni che passano sono lunghi e coperti di nero
mi trascino perduto nei vicoli a maledire una terra straniera
E i giorni son secoli aspettando di poter tornare
di nuovo la fine del mondo cullato dal canto del mare

And now these eyes are unenchanted
And all they see is a faded image of what we used to be

When we don't know a thing about each other anymore

They bring the heat to us
They don't really want the beat in us
Take heed to us
While they plottin and schemin to be deletin us
Best believe in us, they not defeatin us
Them glocks wanna bust
With twenty-one shots to put the leak in us
So they can bloody the street with us
What does it mean to us
You know what they need from us
Give cream to us, hide the lies and deceit from us
That doesn't equal us
Who's ready to get in the Jeep with us
Form a fleet with us and take back the street with us
Meet with us, drop bombs in the street with us
Never saw it comin', attack on the sneak with us
Thus, they can't compete with us
We flow through your veins like DJ's
When they cut, you'll be bleedin us
I came with Kris to heat it up
Showin my body's the temple, hip-hop is the lock
Now put the key in us

If you held yourself up to the light
And the embers never fade in the city by the lake
The place where you were born

Believe, believe in me, believe, believe
In the resolute urgency of now
And if you believe there's not a chance tonight
Tonight, tonight, so glad

We'll crucify the insincere tonight, tonight
We'll make things right, we'll feel it all tonight, tonight

Can you trust him

My ??? in knots
Remember the last niggas you felt they got you robbing shop 
I gots no time for new friends 
Some of the old ones ain't cool 
You ain't kicked it with this nigga since high school 
And you twenty-two now
All a sudden y'all exchanging numbers callin
You don't think that nigga heard you ballin
Fuck that
I smell a rat 
And I can hear the gats click clack
Along with the sirens 
And special forces teams
Or can it be that infrared beam and ski masks
Niggas on a mission who say they gots to have it
I'm grasping at straws
And you think I'm picking with cha
But you gots to stay one up on them niggas 
For they come and get cha 
You figure since y'all go way back them that matters
Sometimes they be the first to ratta tatta

You never know who's real
Who's fake
Who's mask of love disguise hate
You never know 
Break bread sleep in your house 
Then turn around and rat you out

Who's mask of love disguise hate

Verse 2: Mac

Have you ever pulled a caper 
With a nigga who you thought was your ace
Y'all got separated he got caught 
And they took him to that place 
With no hesitation 
He was coughing up all kinds of information 
Ole, master splint ass nigga
Can't handle interrogation
Type of nigga that see your killer
But instead of informing you
Act like he don't see shit
Walk away without warning you
Ain't that cold 
Cause you remember when he had slept on your couch
When his other partner had kicked him out 
For running his god damn mouth
But see ah that's the type of shit your girl was telling you bout
And she told you he was trying to fuck every time you left the house
You thought he was only tripping 
And that she was only bitching
Till you caught in your kitchen 
Trying to shove his little dick in
What you love
So now you in the pen for it
Oh yeah you shot him so now you doing ten for it
Niggas don't give a fuck
They would rob you now 
And drink with you later 
Rape your sister 
Go to school with you 
And cheat on your paper

(Hope as) I will walk away crying
Beautiful voices forever will choke me down

I hope that you look me in the eyes, when I cry
Blink just for a second (Pondering)

Sit back and watch, as the paint will dry

Check your vital signs (Check your vital signs)
As these hearts won't mend (As hearts won't mend)

You won't change as the sky burns me

Another lonely night will await me

As the sky will burn you apart

I'm dying and bleeding of my past
Wasting away. Wasting away from you

How does it feel to be alive?

A tear for the poet 
That can't be heard
Praise the artist 
That steals

Spit me out
I'm glad I don't belong
Save me the speech
You'll be forgotten, gone

It burns, it rips, it hurts
They make you bleed your turn
(It hurts)
The chance of a lifetime
How does it feel to be alive?

Still, she's alone
Embracing anything
Everything was lost
In the wreckage
Grabs a pen
Spills her sorrow
Dancing in the colors of

Feel like I'm trapped inside my mother's womb

Ya shit ain't real unless it's real in the cypher, uh

Minus the static and some batteries for your radio, 'cause yo
Skills are vital if ya enter

Who's next to flex? yeah you know the deal
Chillin' in the cypha where the shit is maaaaad real

Representation, minus comfrontation
Keeps shit funky with the funky sensation
So step up kid, come on kid step up front
And peep out my man while he's rhymin with the blunt
Some kids bring the funk, some kids bring the dissin
Some kids are just whack, but everybody's listenin'
Yeah ya gotta give respect, ? when respect is due
Fuck the bullshit, and the cypha shit is true
The rhymes get spit and the 40's get tapped
Some niggas don't have jack, some niggas got contracts
Representation keep the brothas tighta

To watch the seagulls glide above
So graceful when they are silent
Like lonely white ghosts in the air

I notice they are all unique
With faces that are all their own
Born to kiss the turbulent sky
Before they collapse and die

As I look and dream myself away
A sound grows loud enough to hear
Like disembodied friendly voices
Carried on by southbound winds
I wake up to the sound of silence
Their words are faint and far away
Like the finest spray of water
They still speak of things I know
I turn to fix my eyes on the horizon
And I face the freezing gale
I observe the majestic white waves
As they rise and break and fall

While they rise into the wild wind
It picks them up before it strikes
Steals away their urgent faces
Lifts their spirits to the skies
And their language's soft and broken

I'm trying to see
If I can let go and feel again

Wake up
Wake up

(I'm not awake) I'm slowly burning away
(I'm not ok) I'm falling flat on my face
Down on the pavement, I'm fighting the weight
(I'm not awake) I'm slowly burning away

Sometimes I feel like I can't wake up
I'm trying to breathe
I wanna let go
So I can feel again
I break up
I'm trying to see
If I can let go and feel again

I'm not awake
Feel again

We sat on the street with our beers and our weed
And we blew our smoke up towards the sky

They shooed us away so we walked down a ways
And we did the same damn thing again

And I got nothing but time

And warm these poor beaten insides

Our guts and our hearts
And scream so they'll 
Hear us down in those parks

Under those trees where the pigs lurk and crawl
There are bonfires and parties that are fucking them all
They give it by the inch but they take it by the mile
It's one for the beating and two for the trial

They got nothing to wait for
And we got nothing but time
So I'll swim in these streams
Drown in these dirty streams till I die

So I won't be fooled by his angel light

Sorrow lasts through this night
I'll take this piece of you
And hope for all eternity
For just one second I felt whole
As you flew right through me
And up into the stars

Joy will come

I can only give you everything I've got
I can't be as sorry as you think I should
But I still love you more than anyone else could

All that I keep thinking throughout this whole flight
Is it could take my whole damn life to make this right
This splintered mast I'm holding on won't save me long
Because I know fine well that what I did was wrong

The last girl and the last reason to make this last for as long as I could
The first kiss and the first time that I felt connected to anything
The weight of water, the way you taught me to look past everything I have ever learned
The final word in the final sentence you ever uttered to me was ""love""

We have got through so much worse than this before
What's so different this time that you can't ignore?
You say it is much more than just my last mistake
And we should spend some time apart for both our sakes

The last girl and the last reason to make this last for as long as I could
The first kiss and the first time that I felt connected to anything
The weight of water, the way you taught me to look past everything I have ever learned
The final word in the final sentence you ever uttered to me was ""love""

And I don't know where to look
My words just break and melt
Please just save me from this darkness
Please just save me from this darkness

And I don't know where to look
My words just break and melt
Please just save me from this darkness

Look back as your past is crumbling
As hope denied again, looking into her eyes of hell

You will break

Gears will break, buried away
Beat me to death now
Beat me, beat me to death

As I cry to your ashes as you cry to me

So don't pretend to be my friend
You cannot rectify your mistakes
When every hope carries closure

You have become the denied

Loneliness is a lifetime, as years
Tormented your forced to die
Soaking in a pool of your own blood
Crushed bones engulfed in fire

Forced to fall down
Your blood still stains
(Captive) As this time
(Forever) And civilised structures
(Captive) Will fall away

You are still blood stained

I wonder what went wrong so that she had to roam the streets
She don't do major credit cards, I doubt she does receipts
It's all not quite legitimate

And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance, I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes, yeah, that he's got a driving ban
Amongst some other offenses

And I've seen him with girls of the night
And he told Roxanne to put on her red light
They're all infected but he'll be alright
'Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know?
I said he's a scumbag, don't you know?

Although you're trying not to listen
Avert your eyes and staring at the ground
She makes a subtle proposition
""I'm sorry, love, I'll have to turn you down""
Oh, you know he must be up to summat
What are the chances? Sure it's more than likely
I've got a feeling in my stomach
I start to wonder what his story might be, what his story might be

Yeah, 'cause they said it changes when the sun goes down
Yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down around here
Around here, oh

Look here comes a Ford Mondeo
Isn't he Mister Inconspicuous?
And he don't even have to say 'owt
She's in the stance ready to get picked up
Bet she's delighted when she sees him
Pulling in and giving her the eye
Because she must be fucking freezing
Scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
It don't stop in the winter, no

And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down

They said it changes when the sun goes down

I look like a joker but I feel like a one-eyed jack
Shuffling around, never get to the top of the pack

But he couldn't give a damn
I'm a ramshackle man

Stumbled through the door, that's how it all began

Niggaz in the hood be comin' up feel it
Can you set it off, for again, you know you should
Yo let's that this shit back
To 1989
Where this nigga shoot and bust and niggaz know they couldn't find
Dream Team lovers
Egyptian fan base
Feelin' on the scene, all the fools got erased
Threw a mothafuckin' monkey wrench up in the rap game
Since I hooked up with E, shit ain't ever been the same
Opened up doors for the niggaz that be thinkin'
That your flows be on tizight
Bitin' what I wrizite
Jokin' when I recite
Feelin' manuscripts
When I MC, if it ain't rough it ain't me

Yo mothafuckin' G'z, nigga like Eric Wright
You can floss for your bitch, but you know this shit is tight
'Cause when y'all niggaz started rappin', who'd you try and be?
I'ma slap you cause you lying, if you don't be sayin' me
Or the other 3, that the FBI be phone tappin'
Shoot the government before you niggaz started rappin'
Now its ? city, I gotta bomb it like Iraq
Use my alias, spend my nights at the shack
Ruthless attack all the way to two thou
Try to block it out, but you never knew how
And when I walk through the crowd
I'm seeing mothafucka's bread
I hear their bitches sayin' ask MC Ren
Makin' fools sway when I roll to King Tet's
Because I started cussin' all you fools gettin' checks
Ruthless for life, see that be my state of mind
Y'all can kiss my black ass one more time

I run a hundred miles just so I can MC
Villian want that bomb so I get with L.T.
Ain't nothin' changed
We find 'em, fuck 'em, then flee
While you hatin', pillow talkin', with that bitch, she want me
Niggaz weed crazy, Dre and Snoop turned you out
Now y'all cristal sippin', y'all niggaz be trippin'
Make the West look like ass, all full of shit
Invest in drug money, shit, still gettin' in
What it take for y'all quit
Ruthless got it on lock
Y'all shootin' videos tryin' to look like Pac
Here we come, here we come, blowin' up your spot
My little brother Jubee and the big homie Rock
Full circle, all this shit gon' repeat
When this shit drop, niggaz clownin' in the streets

""The number of they days are cut short
Thy bones are broken to splinters, thy vertebrae are severed.""

Thou art decimated by their violence
Thou fallest backwards as thou retreateth like unto Apep

They spit up on thee and thy rebellion
And turn their back upon thee

Dismemberment and slaughter are on thee
Thy crocodile is trampled underfoot
Thy soul is wrenched from its shade

Damned art thy accursed soul and shadow
Die O one, which art consumed
Thy name is buried in oblivion
Silence covereth thee and thy false one
Down upon thy belly
Be drowned, be drowned, be vomited upon

The gods have pronounced thy doom
They scorn thee and thy false Aten
The ancient ones turn their backs upon thee
Thou art cast down, overthrown
Thy reign of heresy is ended
Those thou hast driven out have risen against thee

Cast down the heretic
Cast down the heretic
Cast down the heretic

Khnemu draggeth thy spawn to the block of slaughter
Sick shalt thou be at the mention of thine own name
Sekhmet teareth out thy bowels and casteth them into flames
She filleth thine orifices with fire
Uadjit shutteth thee in the pits of burning
Nevermore shall you breathe or procreate
Neither thy house or tomb exist
Thou shalt drive thy teeth into thine own body

Overthrown, ended, hacked in pieces, slaughtered, butchered

Something you won't expect

And wear it around your neck

Yet we're still alive and down below
A sea of damned

Wake up from this nightmare that I'm in

And wash away my sins

I will breathe and burn out my eyes

Yet we're still alive and down below

Crashing like a tidal wave

To quench the pain we have
And walk until the end
Until you've reached the sand

Of a hundred thousand wings
Soaring through the sky
At intense speeds
We can't catch with our eyes

You hear the sounds
Of a third carried out
Just wait (just wait)
You hesitate

And your luck is your all,
Then side with whoever you may.
Seek that which within lies waiting to begin
The fight of your life that is everyday.
Dance with the War Child, the War Child

War Child, dance the days and nights away
Sweet child, how do you do today?
In the heart of your heart, there's the tiniest part
Of an urge to live to the death
With a sword on your hip and a cry on your lips
To strike life in the inner child's breast.

I was told what it means to be a man
And now I've reached that age
I've tried to do all those things the best I can
No matter how I try
I find my way to the same old jam

Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown-eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

Sixteen, I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be
It only took a couple of days till she was rid of me
She swore that she would be all mine and love me till the end
But when I whispered in her ear, I lost another friend, oh

Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown-eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown-eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

I know what it means to be alone
I sure do wish I was at home
I don't care what the neighbors say
I'm gonna love you each and every day

You can feel the beat within my heart
Realize, sweet babe, we ain't never gonna part
I feel good when I look into your eyes.

To feel the warm thrill of confusion, that space cadet glow
I've got some bad news for you sunshine
Pink isn't well, he stayed back at the hotel
And they sent us along as a surrogate band
And we're going to find out where you fans really stand

Are there any queers in the theater tonight?
Get 'em up against the wall (Against the wall)
There's one in the spotlight, he don't look right to me
Get him up against the wall (Against the wall)

That one looks Jewish and that one's a coon
Who let all of this riffraff into the room?
There's one smoking a joint and another with spots
If I had my way, I'd have all of you shot

We're wandering now
All in parts and pieces, swim lonely
Find your own way out

I can't see your star
I can't see your star
How can the darkness feel so wrong?

And I'm alone now
Me and all I stood for
We're wandering now
All in parts and pieces, swim lonely
Find your own way out

So far away
It's growing colder without your love
Why can't you feel me
Calling your name?
Can't break the silence
It's breaking me

All my fears
Turn to rage

And I'm alone now
Me and all I stood for

Something else just floated away
There ain't a single thing that I've found
With wings that decided to stay

Or maybe it's the space where the phone didn't call
Or Maybe it's this thing in my chest

Perhaps the price is just too steep
Is your conscious at rest
If once put to the test
You awake with a start
To just the beating of your heart
Just one man beneath the sky
Just two ears just two eyes

You set sail across the sea
Of long past thoughts and memories
Childhood's end your fantasies
Merge with harsh realities
And then as the sail is hoist
You find your eyes are growing moist
And all the fears never voiced
Say you have to make the final choice

Who are you and who am I
To say we know the reason why?
Some are born some men die
Beneath one infinite sky
There'll be war there'll be peace
But everything one day will cease
All the iron turn to rust
All the proud men turn to dust
So all things time will mend
And so this song will end

My head it tends to stray away sometimes I can't see clear

Sometimes it rains, sometimes it pours
Sometimes I'm not that sure
But anytime you look at me
Your thoughts I can't ignore
The second hand would pass us by
Should one of us had blinked
But in a minute realize that true love always waits

(B1)
It's Big 1 son, Jamaica Queens is the turf
And I'ma exploit, heaven and earth, for what it's worth
It's the MC extrordinaire, the jewels glare
The God is rare, I'm takin' bitches back to my lair
I want mines and yours, strippin niggaz to they drawers
No probable cause, with the chrome double 4's
It's the Queens New Yorker with a bulletproof parka
In eighty-four, it was Calvins and British Walkers
Now I'm sippin Harvey's Bristal Cream with the glock 17
As the sirens race to the scene
Tryin' to get dough, like Pablo, today, fuck tomorrow
Seats for carro, as I recline in Monte Carlo
I got the game down to a science, it's the clients
That turn small time hustlers into giants
Three course meal, waitin for my appetizer
Blowin' like a geyser, time only makes me wiser
Paraphenalia, and material, makes the crew imperial
I put the fear in you, sippin beer with two
Handlin business properly, form a monopoly
Storefront property, if not, another robbery
I'm puttin' forth the effort, murder's the method
The steak is peppered
Son when I let off you meet your Lord and shepherd
Bloody money gets niggaz deaded and wetted
Don't forget it, money's the metal and my hand is magnetic

Chorus: Grimm, B1

I gotta flip these bricks
Cause bein broke drive me insane
Money's on my motherfuckin brain
From O-Z's to ki's
The triple beam brings fame to my name
Money's on my motherfuckin brain
Niggaz be scheamin and teamin
But still I maintain
Money's on my motherfuckin brain
Cause money and murder go hand in hand
It ain't nothin' but a game
Money's on my motherfuckin brain son

(Grimm)
Cryin hopin God forgive me for the ones I killed
But until still, I dry my eyes with hundred dollar bills
Like McDonald's, makin' mills servin'
Fuck a Landcruiser now, pulls a ? to Suburban
Stressed out, sittin' thinkin' past bed time
Scared can't sleep, nightmares about fed time
Diamonds, linens, ostrich and all that
Fat shit I'm talkin' code cause my phone's tapped
Crackheads worship me like I'm Jesus
Uncle Sam can't stand me 'cause I'm fuckin' all his nieces
Cuties every colour, who I wanna fuck next?
Buy a new car, maybe Lamborghini trunk next
Look at the jealousy in the eyes of the roughnecks
Bulletproof glass just in case they wanna buck Tecs
A large ratio in this game dies
But I'm flippin pies, till the Senate legalize

Chorus: Grimm, G. Rap (same lines)

(Kool G. Rap)
I'm sportin flavors and Timbs, a ninety-five Bezn with the chrome rims
Presedential Rolex, two carat diamonds with the stone gems
Pockets filled with lucci leather wallets designed by Gucci
Parlay in restaurants, eatin shrimp, scampi and sushi
Fly minks, with icicles that blink inside cuban links
Lookin' ?, brothers stink, got loot like I'm doin' banks
Hundred dollar bottles of chammy, condos in Miami
Front row seats up at the Grammy's, the broke niggaz can't stand me
Hold the flame low, hotel suites inside the Flamingo
Just home by the dingos, I step up in 'em rockin' Kangols
Straight up fakin no jacks, cause all my crackshacks are jam packed
My mad stacks, show that I'm on the right track, like Amtrak
So stand back, 'cause I'ma make whatever it takes
To shake Jakes, and shoot snakes, and bake more snowflake cakes than Drake's
Cut up your grill like I'm the Barber of Seville
Still like Gotti bodies are found inside the harbor 'cause I'm ill
It's war, but no more kids are bein kidnapped, matter of fact
Ain't with the shit black, I was young when I did that
There's dope in the Copa Cabanas, cock back the hammers
So niggaz in pajamas get they wigs split like bananas
Stable of hotties, niggaz with shotties catchin bodies
Neighborhood John Gotti with more notes than Pavarotti
Yeah, paid as a motherfuckin bank teller
The Goodfella, I stay a motherfuckin drug seller

We are just stood here
Waiting for the next great wound

And we just can't wait to make more mistakes
And to fluff our breaks
And to stuff our faces with cake

Nobody loves us
Dab-hands at Trouble
With four days of stubble, we are
Never loosen the grip on our hand
Call us home
Kiss our cheeks
Nobody loves us
So we ... oh, we tend to please ourselves

People think all we do
Is lie around and think of how
Rich we'd be if we didn't think
Life could improve

And we just can't wait to make more mistakes
And we just can't wait
Till the whole thing blows up in our face

So, never loosen the grip on our hand
Call us home

All pie-eyed, and bog-eyed, and cross-eyed
Oh, never loosen the grip on our hand
Whack us, then
Hug us hard
Nobody loves us
So we ... oh ... we tend to please ourselves

And we just can't stress, oh, how more the mess
And complete distress won't make much difference to us

Born-again atheists
Practising troublemakers
Make us our
Favourite jam
Nobody loves us
Useless and shiftless
And jobless

With Afrika Bambaataa - he threw the first one, that I attended
We kept the tradition going through the Stop the Violence Movement
Through Human Education Against Lies, Rhythm Cultural Institute
And now the Temple of Hip-Hop
This is Hip-Hop's spiritual base
And as a spiritual base, we look to guide the youth in that discipline
Uh, no culture is a culture, unless it has principles
Unless it has morals, unless - we are unified
In some sort of principle, something we are not going to step beyond
Something that defines us
What I'd like to do, is just for a moment as we... deal with this
Think about your role in Hip-Hop
Think about what you do everyday in Hip-Hop
This is not about right now
It's about twenty years from now
It's about ten years from now
The tapes are rolling, the notes are being taken
This is the type of thinking we have to get into
If this is going to survive and last
So again, Hip-Hop Appreciation Week, is a time of self-reflection
A time for Hip-Hoppers to ask,
""What am I doing, to preserve the culture?"" {*echoes*}

<b>The Silver Cord</b>
""Do you still see me even here?""
(The silver cord lies on the ground.)
""And so I'm dead"", the young man said - over the hill (not a wish away).
My friends (as one) all stand aligned, although their taxis came too late.
There was a rush along the Fulham Road.
There was a hush in the Passion Play.

Such a sense of glowing in the aftermath ripe with rich attainments
All imagined sad misdeeds in disarray the sore thumb screams aloud,
Echoing out of the Passion Play.
All the old familiar choruses come crowding in a different key:
Melodies decaying in sweet dissonance.
There was a rush along the Fulham Road
Into the Ever-passion Play.

And who comes here to wish me well?
A sweetly-scented angel fell.
She laid her head upon my disbelief
And bathed me with her ever-smile.
And with a howl across the sand
I go escorted by a band of gentlemen in leather bound
NO-ONE (but someone to be found).

<b>Memory Bank</b>
All along the icy wastes there are faces smiling in the gloom.
Roll up roll down, Feeling unwound? Step into the viewing room.
The cameras were all around. We've got you taped; you're in the play.
Here's your I.D. (Ideal for identifying one and all.)
Invest your life in the memory bank; ours the interest and we thank you.
The ice-cream lady wets her drawers, to see you in the passion play.

Take the prize for instant pleasure,
Captain of the cricket team
Public speaking in all weathers,
A knighthood from a queen.

<b>Best Friends</b>
All of your best friends' telephones never cooled from the heat of your hand.
There's a line in a front-page story, 13 horses that also-ran.
Climb in your old umbrella.
Does it have a nasty tear in the dome?

But the rain only gets in sometimes and the sun never leaves you alone.

<b>Critique Oblique</b>
Lover of the black and white it's your first night.
The Passion Play, goes all the way, spoils your insight.
Tell me how the baby's made, how the lady's laid,
Why the old dog howls in sadness.

And your little sister's immaculate virginity wings away
On the bony shoulders of a young horse named George
Who stole surreptitiously into her geography revision.
(The examining body examined her body.)

Actor of the low-high Q, let's hear your view.
Peek at the lines upon your sleeves since your memory won't do.
Tell me: how the baby's graded, how the lady's faded,
Why the old dogs howl with madness.

All of this and some of that's the only way to skin the cat.
And now you've lost a skin or two, you're for us and we for you.
The dressing room is right behind,
We've got you taped, you're in the play.
How does it feel to be in the play?
How does it feel to play the play?
How does it feel to be the play?

Man of passion rise again, we won't cross you out:
For we do love you like a son, of that there's no doubt.
Tell us: is it you who are here for our good cheer?
Or are we here for the glory, for the story, for the gory satisfaction
Of telling you how absolutely awful you really are?

There was a rush along the Fulham Road.
There was a hush in the Passion Play.

When you fight monsters
It's at the risk of becoming one yourself

Wildest of the wild
One stood against the wall
While the other pulled the trigger

And as bullets ripped flesh apart
One dream died as the other forgot
So these are the killing fields

Of sharpening knives

Where mass graves are dug
For the piles so high.

From dungeons of despair and farce to feast on brackish hearts

Beheld by missive magot-pies, prophetic in their crow

In vested misery, thy devils damn thee black
Not all great Neptune's oceans may ever cleanse your robes

For Weyward Sisters guide the hand, the hand that held the scythe
To lands undiscerned in tongue, Cimmerians have roamed

Infidels of tawny hue cannot hide behind
The cross that bore a bastard child and reigns in fiery fear

No ends of earth may stifle choirs oracular from magot-pies
Perched upon a hungry vault to witness serpent's jaws

Mandibles, sabre-lined, ruthless tear through flesh
Grant the mercy shown to those in dungeons of the past

Forsaken hymn cacophonous concluded long and drawn
To realms of stank lagoons retreats Leviathan to find repose

(Killa Kal)
I know you see me at the do', I'm in a Coupe on dubs
You in the lot, trying to pop it your hoop on hubs
You and your group at the club, trying to shoot your slugs
You think a nigga won't box you, or shoot your mug
I just came here to party baby, drank and roam blocks
Get a thicky thick chick, and get a quick dome shot
Got a sick chrome glock, and it cough at niggaz
I came here to fuck with women, I talk to niggaz
I'm here often nigga (doing what), buying the bar
Getting crunk with my click, might be eyeing a star
I see white eyeing a bar, while I sip my Belve
Walked over (grabbed her hand), and with her lips she tells me
(Get thoed) hell yeah boo, I'm one of the ones
So I pull her close to me, hands under her buns
But it's one thing about her, I just got to know
If she cutting tonight shorty, then I got to go

This for them ballas in the back of the club
Niggaz that don't know, how to act in the club
And them 600's, and the them 'Lacs at the club
Stay iced up, looking good in the club
Get fucked up, chunk up your hood in the club

(Sir Daily)
Now Daily pull up to the spot, at 12 o'clock on the dot
Looking for a chickenhead, bopper to bop
Twenty inches spinning slow, as I crawl in the lot
Gold diggers flag me down, trying to get me to stop
But oh no, a nigga recognized disguise
I looked past that thick ass, and them big ol' thighs
I'm A G, I peep game constantly
So tell me what the fuck, do you want from me
I'm at the bar, taking shots to the head
Trying to find a yellow bone, that give shots to the head
I see a fine looking dime, and she rocking some red
Spit a line and she mine, while she drop in my bed
It's guaranteed, to put a young bitch on her knees
Blue Boyz on the rise, with a mission to see
Slim Thug or Sir Daily, and my nigga Kyleon
We party all night, till six in the morn' ha

(Slim Thug)
I'm V.I.P., in the back of the club
Slim Thee, they call me the best dressed thug
Your misses trying to get a Boss, kisses and hugs
But your misses get nothing, but diss and mugs
I don't give dick to chicks, that give it up to scrubs
Trying to find the finest bitch, up in the club
Make her up that thing, get in her ear
And fill her up, with game
Ten times out of ten, I'ma cut that thang
Got the broad giving up the brain, like it ain't nothing mayn
I'm a P-I-M-P, simple to me
And talk hoes out they clothes, so easily
I rock platinum rings, platinum piece and platinum car
And I'm bout to be, a platinum star
V.I.P. by the bar, is where you'll see me staying
With the Roley on my wrist, and the Crys in hand man

376,"This is hard for me to write it's difficult to express this
Its heavy on my shoulders and the weight gets relentless
The story of brothers and a beautiful friendship
And how relations get strained with pressure and tension
Who's wrong, correct, so, so, subjective
You look back its hard 'cause the mind gets adventurous
Dates get mixed up facts disconnected
The only thing you remember is the feeling that you're left with
It started as a blessing

Now you could write this off as luck or one of life's coincidences
But at some point you think god damn what are the chances
People with similar interests and influences
Coming together at that moment to form a kinship
It's like you knew that you was brothers before your conception
Even if you're not a spiritual person I admit shit
At that point I wasn't but at some point it sets in
It be foolish to dismiss this as coincidence
Now this shit is different, somewhere this is written
Be part of a mission, this shit is predestined
Closer than close like flesh is to tendon
Share my 50 cent bag of chips with my freshman
Half a half a gas station sandwich no question
Talking shit to me well then talking shit to him then
Family is sacred it must be protected
Family is sacred and it must be protected

Over time I don't know what happens something got infected
People grow in different ways at different rates I guess
It ridiculous, little shit it suddenly gets big shit
Lapses in communication, glitches in the system
He said that she said what nobody said shit
But you'll never know 'cause everyone's passive aggressive
I sit down smoke pow wow how everyone said shit
People cease to make the effort to get to the essence
Peep this shit out though this shit is really twisted
Funny thing is that you and I do it every minute
We take it in rhetoric every time somebody says shit
Against us stock piling every little incident
What's stupid is all the bullshit that's circulating
Could be fixed in an instant with simple conversation
But you know how pride is
A bitch with her fist clenched
That mixed with the fat drama gets addictive
Wounds need dressing and they don't receive attention
It snowballs and festers and creates resentment
People demonise each other brave discontent
But nobody could've been prepared for the next step
The nature of the predator is calculated pensive
Waiting in the brush patiently revving they engines
Despite the colour that they got all they see is crimson
Waiting for they prey to become desperate defenceless
Outside is always over just beyond the fences
Today the gate is open though today they make an entrance
Friendly at first laughs jokes like we best friends
Slowly though you start to see they become hidden agendas
Nine to five one day insecure self perceptions
Shines a spotlight on all those paranoid self perceptions
Things begin to heat up everyone's already stretched thin
How could you be well how could you be so deceptive
Any second now someone will snap like a bread stick
And what once was simply dissolves like a breath mint
Just like that you start to ask yourself questions
Is this really worth all the emotion and depressment
Do the benefits and perks outweigh the pressure
Let me step back give this relationship assessment

I'm tied up in the basement, blindfolded by nine soldiers
With rare paintings and fine sculptures, they spoke blatant
Their nine's loaded, they put a gat to the back of the blind poet
I want to cry but I try and hold it, one of them notice
Crack me over the skull with a crime motive
They made a toast to my death, I rose to my feet
With the heat close to my flesh
May I say these last words to my enemies passing the Earth?
Laughing at my passion and merge, ""Ok, kill me if y'all wanna""
Slay me and never play the corner, cold winters
You're all gonners, tell your momma call the coroners
You get me, and God gets you, it makes sense don't it?

In the heat of the moment, my enemies feel
The heat from my chrome kick, I can't sell
You hit an opponent, the shit gets real
In the heat of the moment, y'all know the deal

After the sunshine there's rain, after the laughter there's pain
After my chapter there's flames, after the rapture the master shall reign
Shockwaves blacken the terrain, and man looks strange
Open the book, see I'm king, read my name, and see thy wings
Believe I changed, I went with the horse, slept at the pastor's door
Heard the whispers through my enemy's walls
Rode the elevator to the thirteenth floor
Console with Gandi, since God placed his hands upon me
I rose up commanding the army, demanding my laundry
Talk to monks, holding a pump, y'all niggaz wanna roll, what y'all want?
Shout at Satan, shout at the pagans, cats wavin', one of the brave men

Slipped somethin' in my drink with an ice cube
Nice move, bright jewels, she's with this white dude

389,"Fed up with ""made you look""
And dirty crooks without a clue
They all wear the same face
And it says, ""Hangman, I'm onto you""

Hangman, it's not your fault
Commit this to memory
The bright ideas
Always get lost along the way

Last call for medicine
To count me in and turn me loose
I never meant to hide anything
But I'll never tell the truth

Hangman, it's not your fault
Commit this to memory
The bright ideas
Always get lost along the way

Commit this to memory, commit this to memory
Commit this to memory, commit this to memory
Commit this to memory, commit this to memory
Commit this to memory

I'm just a guy that never tried
I'm just a stupid fuck with brilliant luck and sometimes a bright idea
So shower me in a chorus of compliments and verse I don't deserve
I might run but I'll never hide

Hey, that's not right
You can't complain
""Everything's gonna be just fine""
Said the pen to the dotted line

If memory serves
Then mark my words
This game's called ""catch me if you can""
And with wine will salute all our bitterness

Fed up with ""made you look""
And dirty crooks without a clue
They all wear the same face
And it says, ""Hangman I'm onto you""

390,"So, how much do you know?
Do I have to leave here
Pack my bags and get out by tomorrow
Can I stay just another day?

Meanwhile, you ask how I'm doing
You start to smile and ask how much I'm using
But wait, I just can't contemplate
Where I have been

What was at first thick as mud
Is now as clear as can be
And when I waste all my money
On filthy pornography
And now this harpy inside
She's got me down on my knees
On my knees

391,"It starts with almost nothing,
But then you feel the fire.
It builds from just a feeling,
But then your need turns dire.

You don't know where it came from,
And you thought you wouldn't dare.
You don't know what will happen,
And you don't know if you care.

Do you see the confusion?
Where do you think this will lead?
Do you feel the commotion?
Why do you feel so much need?

Certainty. Certainty.
All I would need is certainty.

Why do you keep me from certainty?
How could you take it away from me?

It hurts more than anything,
My world now turns to ashes.
Your silence so demeaning,
My heart falters in flashes.

I would still like to believe,
But I know my trust is broken.
I would yet want to prevail,
But I know my hope is token.

Do you see desparation?
Why don't you care anymore?
Do you fear conflagration?
Why to make me feel so sore?

Certainty. Certainty.
All I would need is certainty.

Why do you keep me from certainty?
How could you take it away from me?

The water reaches above my head.

A cold body remains in my stead.

To the bottom, how fast I would go
Just waiting for me under the tree
And out in the snow

A cowboy, a nurse or a fireman
There's so many things that you can be
You can set bigger goals, but set your soul
Yeah, set your soul free

Times, places and situations
Lead us to an early grave
When we get there we see
Just what did we save?

If your heart is a flame burning brightly
You'll have light and you'll never grow cold
And soon you will know that you just grow
You're not growing old

If the wheels of your wagon are rusty
You can paint them until they are new
You can roll down a hill, but if you can't
Then I pity you

I've covered many miles
And if I could search forever
For what's right before my eyes
Just when I thought I'd found it
It wasn't nothing like I'd planned
And when I got my heart around it
It slipped right through my hands
Here with you I feel it
Close my eyes and see it

In a midnight talk
In a morning kiss
When I'm in your arms
That's where it is
When we're tangled up
And can't resist
When we feel that rush
That's where it is... That's where it is

When I'm crashing through the madness
Not sure who I'm supposed to be
When I'm caught up in the darkness
It's your hand that's leading me
You bring me back to solid ground
You lift me up right here, right now

It's a lifetime filled
With tiny graces
The biggest things
In the smallest places

In the sweetest smile
On a night like this
In a tender touch
That's where it is
When we're tangled up
And can't resist
When we fill that rush
That's where it is... That's where it is

The ghosts of pain are always here
My soul - it wanders endlessly
On paths where hell is leading me
On paths where hell is leading me

Someday
May our souls embrace again
Please believe me
Just lay your hand on my heart

Someday
No time to say good-bye
And if we touch our hands
Then the sun will fill the sky

Your venom flows throughout my veins
My stronghold's fragile and too weak

I ain't gon' lie girl it must be somethin' 'bout you
'Cause we ain't knew each other long and you already my boo
I like your style you try to be mad, I make you smile
You lay up under my arms like a new born child
I'm thinking back to my teenage love, my teenage life
How I use to say that I ain't gon' do this twice
But I'm a man now it can't get better or worse
And I know its hard to understand that my baby is first
But I got family to provide for, put shit aside for
You know its people in the world I'd die for
So what's you're plan?, I'm not a full time man
But I'm doing what I can maybe you'll understand
But its all right sugar so let you're feelings hang out
'Cause when I'm diggin deep inside I know you like it alot
I got this thug passion to put you in the mood
And then you hear my cell ring, you catchin a attitude
Lets set da record straight you knew what it was from da start
And I'm just the typa nigga that'll mess up ya heart
We spent nights together, we took flights together
And if I wanted to see the world you was down for whatever
I'm ya lover man, can't be ya other man
Ain't no tellings when you ain't gon' find another man
I'm a be dreamin' so wont you please come true
Cause every time I close my eyes I swear I see you, dreamin'

'Cause when I close my eyes
I see you (I see you)
If this is a dream please come true
'Cause when I close my eyes
I see you (I see you)

Let's get ya mind right 'cause I'm on another page
Looking for quaility time I live on the stage
That's ya stress look I want ya best look
Ya long hair, high heels, short skirt, but deep dress
Look you gotta man so you need to kick back
And you said ya really love him ain't nothin' wrong wit dat
So what's the deal? with the sad thing, the mad thing?
Everytime you see a nigga you talkin' 'bout a change
You needa chill, relax, and be cool up on da real
Keep ya head focused so you know what it is
But you been down for a minute tho you ain't da average ho
Ain't no need to lie its gon' be hard to let you go
Lets take it slow and not to fast girl this is thug world
Chocolate, and vanilla that's a hell of a swirl
Holdin' hands up on the beach you use to love that shit
Shoppin' sprees in New york you know we stayed in a mink
You doin' 9-to 5, you know I do it live
And when you layin down and sick that's when I come beside
This ain't no perfect match and it might not happen
Just to give it to you straight I'm in love wit rappin'
That's all right though I'm tryna get mo
I made my way up to the front, and out the back do'
And just to let you know that I'm still the same
We was friends from the start it ain't gon' never change, dreamin'

Isn't it a gamble
Layin' your heart out on the floor
Nothin' short of a miracle
When you find the one you're looking for
It's another kind of trouble trying to hang on to who you are
When all you wanna do is lose yourself in someone else's arms
Isn't it a wonder (that) we got this far

Some people aren't lucky like us
Some people they just give up
When the hard times fall
The thrill of it all is gone
Leaves you in a cloud of dust
It's sad to think that some won't find it
And others won't recognize it even when it comes
We're all at the mercy of the will of love
Some people yeah
Some people aren't lucky like us

Two lonely souls that just stumbled into fate
Look how much we've been given babe
In spite of all of our mistakes
And I will never forget I've been blessed with the gift of lovin' you
And when the going ain't easy babe
A little faith will pull us through
Thank God we have eachother we can hang onto

To have someone you can laugh with
Someone you can cry with
Tell all your secrets to
To have someone who won't judge you
Someone who just loves you
No matter what, they stand beside you

398,"While you've been dreaming of the dead and lost
I have been awake kissing these clock faces
The fear of sleep has left me tired and worn
But in her dreams is where I will haunt her

I've seen the shadows of this burning angel
These city lights will never be as beautiful as your eyes
I'll pick up the pieces when you've failed and fallen to the ground
Let my words set and fall upon your unwilling ears
It will be okay

I took to the sky, did you mourn for me?
Well, who needs flowers when they're dead and buried
For now, my whisper is my dearest friend
But even I know this won't last forever

I've seen the shadows of this burning angel
These city lights will never be as beautiful as your eyes
I'll pick up the pieces when you've failed and fallen to the ground
Let my words set and fall upon your unwilling ears
It will be okay

Smile when you think of me, the pain will go in time
I may be alone with fear in my mind
I leave these words in hope that that we'll meet again
Again. Now? I know this won't last forever

Don't you ask about me, ask 'bout somebody else (Once I've fallen there's many stories to tell)
I can't feel it, won't embrace it, it's overwhelming how far ya take it (Stuck in a state of questioning)
And don't you tell me you know we' re destined, you won't convince me, I won't listen (Resentment building, you've put
Our lives on hold)

Trashed and scattered again, I'm feelin' so low
You waste your breath while fuckin' with me, my blood is so cold
My destination is always unknown, I'll find my way there

I won't be the victim, but the first to cast a stone
Sedated nights to the bar room fights as metropolis takes its toll
And don't you try to stop me, it's a place you'll never know
Don't try to judge or take shots at me, I'll never let you seize control

Play your game and walk away your integrity don't mean shit
Crawl on me you fucking parasite, and I'm gonna take you out

Label me, that's fine, I'll be somebody else (Nothing in front of me but holes ahead)
Lie about my life, have a story to tell (Lights went down, was on the edge and I fell)
Oh you're so insightful, let me remind you to twist and break me, should make you worried (Long way to go and you're
Right there)
Two-faced liar, don't try and know me, deceit brings fire, makes sure you can't breathe (Pick at pieces of my body below)

I never bothered with all the rumors, too much garbage (all the same)
I'll stand right here, come on you falsehood deceitful liar (There's no shame)
Don't ever take my side, I know you're never right, I'll justify the means (Nothing's what it seems)
I'll stand around and fight, but there's no point tonight, been chained to this machine

Trashed and scattered again, I'm feelin' so low
You waste your breath while fuckin' with me, my blood is so cold
My destination is always unknown, I'll find my way there

I walk down these roads alone and now you're seen here
My feelings that I'm having towards you are perfectly clear (I control this ride)
My devils appetite is tonight and now I'm all right

Don't try to judge or take shots at me, I'll never let you seize control

Don't try and get the best of me (No one can help but your own self)
City makes my body ache (Lonely, don't try and prey on me)
I feel your world keep dying, no more use in tryin'

But hell, why should I wait 
Till the clouds go rain on some other sucker's parade 

I've had my share of heartaches, let-downs and tricks
But the everyday blues is the one thing I can't fix 
And I've heard those holy brethren muttering my name 
But it ain't no sin to drink when you're suffering 

Patience, they say, is a saintly virtue 
But hell, why should I wait 
Till the clouds go rain on some other sucker's parade 

When every heavy skyline just empties on your fate 
Sometimes keeping dry's something to celebrate 

So if the road of sin is the one I'm taking

My niggas ride where they bust at
Die where they bust at my murderous guys
Slinging them pies where they lust at
Or corners where they hang most
Name boast and bank toast
Drive with the thing close
Slide with a James post
Empty clips is on now
Coke fiends are strung out
Broke niggas bum out
Jakes holdin' they gun out
When back streets are taped up
Bodies laying faced up
Cats running with ace up
The spots get 'em paced up
The street lamps are broke now
Mad bitches to bone now
When niggas peep your home out
And flip when they zoned out
Thugs bringing the street war
Bust shots let the heat roar
Taking trips to be more
With bricks up in to fiend off
The towns where they spray shit
Bust rounds and lay shit
Selling pounds' a great shit
And clowns get their face-lift
Spots where gats pop off
Shots clear the block off
Slugs knock your block off
And have you licking hot sauce

On the corners where the dice roll
And clubs where the ice glow
The lames get their life stole
And bleed from a knife fold
Niggas laying they law down
Some draw with a four-pound
PJ's are tore down
Thoughts of laying hos down (The streets)
Blocks where they lick shots
And rock what the fifth cocked
Kids cop the six drop
From brick box and zip locks
Towns where niggas kill at
Posting where it's real at
Keeping gats concealed at
See a foe you peel at
Strip where you get ripped off
Hot lead get licked off
Fronting and your clicks off
All your jewels get stripped off
Sidewalks where they creep up
Get locked up with a street bop
Kids running with heats up
Lifting both of your feets up
Niggas they let their guns loose
They wild guns loose
Gat up under the chin
Blow a niggas shit through the sunroof
Decide where they pack nines
The chrome gat shines
You try to clap mine
You outta line niggas get flat lined

Now Chickens a get your crew laced
For rocks and a blue face
Niggas giving they screwface
For the loot and the suitcase
Spots that blood spills on
And dealers clock a 'mil on
Murderers get their kill on
Mad cash is ill-on
Beef turning to combat
For life so they pump gats
Little kids they harm that
Put bombs where your moms at
Niggas tied up and kidnapped
And smacked up with big gats
Get found with they wig cracked
Leave 'em right where they live at (The streets)
Running for red beams
Blood flowing in red streets
Mad fellas with bread schemes
Running from the FED team
Little shorties are knocked up
Straight giving their crouch up
Juveniles decide to pee now with they ox up
Crack blocks and weed spots
The fiends up in the Detox

Here we go again
A beautiful girl and some dirty old men
Before we continue the task at hand

From the land of volcanoes
The lovely lucia

She screams like a banshee and she moves like a cat
I could tell you much more but let's leave it at that

The lord of lard
The mighty swine
He loves manchego and a bottle of wine
Also known as raymond watts
He screams out his lungs while his brain slowly rots

The one and only
The great steve white
His morals are loose but his shirts are tight
Challenged by few
Rivaled by none
He's a low down dirty son of a gun

This is the biscuit's crux
Solid rock against the flux
Ultra-heavy beat deluxe
KMFDM forever sucks
Here's your voice from the underground
Get ready for another round
Nothing new, it's the same old shit
If it works this good why fuck with it

Andy selway the master of skins
Frequently found screwing chicks behind bins
His hobbies include but aren't limited to
Things you and I would rather not do

And here we have jules
The king of guitar
He's only home when he's inside a bar
Rings and spikes and chains and tattoos
He breeds new lifeforms inside his shoes

I am kapt'n K
The korruptor of youth
My word is gospel of the honest truth
I am the father of industrial rock
And if you don't believe me
You can suck my glock

Connecting the tide to the sand that was dry
And we both laid entwined, stared at the night
Clouds overhead, but that was all right
'Cause then and there with the wind in your hair
Heaven was jealous to merely look fair against you
And all I need now is for this moon to keep light in its desolate skyline for good

'Cause these are the nights that you know when you're there
You couldn't have planned it much better I swear and you hope
That your senses aren't failing you now
And you think to yourself now I could be wrong
But I might have just stolen this scene from a song and you know
That your senses aren't failing you now, but they're slipping away

So divine is this happening
Can't I just graze your skin
For the rest of our time
But time isn't letting this night go on
Till then and there, the wind in your hair
Nothing in this world could keep me from staring at you
And all I need now is for that sun to stay under its glowing horizon for good, whoaoaoa

'Cause these are the nights that you know when you're there
You couldn't have planned it much better I swear and you hope
That your senses aren't failing you now
And you think to yourself now I could be wrong
But I might have just stolen this scene from a song and you know
That your senses aren't failing you now

Droppin' street knowledge, plus a nigga Islamic
Hoodrats they do the hoochie boogie for a fuck,

For real, and bitch-made-niggaz get they caps peeled
When I walk, puts a hole in the floor, with the steel toe
As if you didn't know, now that you know nigga act like you knew
And if you continue trippin', motherfuck you

With the help of 187 on this tight ass track

Everytime that I'm spit, get cha lit
Get cha lifted, get cha high as you wanna go
Breakin fools off that wanna floss your gold

I hate short stoppers and I hate laggers

So they can beat your shit, and jack your ass
I give 'em 187 times to try
But on the real, they better off committin suicide
Slide me the tech Ren, so I can show 'em
That I'm not to be trusted, and not to be fucked with
And definitely not that motherfucker they wanna press they luck with
I keep it goin' uncut, and if I get mad enough
I shoot they whole fuckin' set up
And don't say I didn't warn ya
It ain't funny, when you be a victim by the corner
187 be the gate keeper

Well how in the hell am I gonna deal with new niggaz
That be comin' hollerin wolf, and ain't put out shit yet
Rollin' down the street in my 4-5-0
Throwin' wack niggaz shit out my window
Cause rarely do I see niggaz that be comin' with that funky ass shit
That make you say fuck ay, go shoot a nigga down,
But here comes that black nigga that they call Ren
Makin' niggaz go and act crazy again
Niggaz be fuckin' fools for the hell of it
Some down old niggaz better not come this way
'Cause I just don't give a fuck, 'cause I get in a baby gangsta mode
Bitch slappin niggaz with my fist
'Cause I insist I'm a hell of a lyricist
But my roots in the street
Killin' playa haters over some wicked ass beats
Me and my niggaz come and get your ass
Then me and my niggaz beat up on that ass

And put 'em on record, I'll give you a second
I want to add authenticity to your tape
So when it's sold out in the street
You all can know this was a real party

These are poems circulating throughout the nation
Everybody's bad and everybody's tough
But how many people are intelligent enough
To open up their eyes and see through the lies
Discipline themselves, yourself to stay alive?
Not many
That's why the universe sent me today on this stage
With this to to say
The rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer
And in the final hour many heads will lose power
What does the rich versus the poor really mean?
Psychologically it means you got to pick your team
When someone says the rich gets richer
Visualize wealth and put yourselves in the picture
The rich get richer, 'cause they work towards rich
The poor get poorer, cause their minds can't switch from the ghetto
Let go, it's not a novelty
You could love your neighborhood without loving poverty
Follow me, every mother, father, son, daughter
There's no reason to fear the New World Order
We must order the whole new world to pay us
The New World Order and the old state chaos
The Big Brother watching over you, is a lie you see
Hip-Hop could build it's own secret society
But first you and I got to unify
Stop the niggativity and control our creativity
The rich is getting richer, so why we ain't richer?
Could it be we still thinking like niggas?
Educate yourselves, make your world view bigger
Visualize wealth and put yourselves in the picture!

415,"On a sunny afternoon in lower east side New York...
You about ready? (Yeah)
Good morning my sweet vision of morbid disorder
And good evening wonderful riddance and such
Maybe today I'll touch the burgundy halo
Trimming the tunnels and offend with tenants
Spangled cross a more tangible premise
This splendor shit needs splinters all up in day-tripper visuals
Take it easy man, fuck it I'll take it any way I can
My palms are generous
When I witness fury scurry past my window
Model city in a bottle plugged hostile
Its bliss kissing polluting
And a billion suckers pucker in a bind
Maybe the sunken ship is the treasure
No, but they insist it man
I try to spin me dizzy sponging
Spongin up the given dungeons functions
As opposed to art historians absorbed inside assumptions
Everybody pop your knuckles when the style divorces vertical
Marveling at the spite with which it curdled
Outside my tenement grows a little warmth
From out the mugs of masons wasted
Laying bricks for days to later find they owned the lot adjacent
Mark the blasphemy elements of elegance and savagery
Murder the gossip, fuck it run off happily
The broken spoke cyclers choking open doctors they as born fetus
In a matchbox conveniently padlocked to the hammer base
Now these impurities embedded in five illiterate's textiles
Shedded in the hell tale to motivate blind suspended leverage
Now I'm drowning in a pool of... why are you here?
Sabotage with my beast of burden pertinence of if I die this year
My name is Dry spell
My name is pillar
My name's allegiance
My name is flagrant
My name's a thousand steps from patience
But I'm sick and tired of waiting
My name's Polaris
My name is canvas
My name is lowlife
My name's intention
My name is every imperfection that plays a part in my dissension
My name is carnival
My name is posture
My name is polarized

My name is delicate approach from symmetrically to my fellowship
My name's possessive
My name is cordial
My name is igloo
My name is captivate
My name is contaminate the rich
And clock the profits for the captive's sake
Let us hope that the horrors of evil no longer loiter on the doorstep of your past
Circle of sandbags drag the shield a meal the meaty hand grabs
I'm splitting hopes at your local Acropolis
Opulence in a cockpit not the pocket for them born with a pepper toss
Sunk to rest while they've exhausted the art of drunken address
Exhibit fracture lines that converge towards where the hackers whine
Where trappers slack the traps
Unlatch the catch then cover up his trackers line
That will make his majesty furious
Oh bury his head and how could I have been so dense
If only, yeah but I'm lonely
My days graze normalcy then morbidly crash
My years breathe honesty then sardonically laugh
Alas, I dig my toes in to the sand and spit foliage out my lips personifying mankind's end all aspirations
Hope floats...
No, hope sinks like broken boats and most harassed before provoked
I'm tossing darts at a map of the arts to pick up where you choked
And when the last leaf falls off the branches of resonance
I'll be waiting with my butterfly net to collect the evidence
Well I am a room with poison oak scaling the sides
Arachnids on the ceiling, rugged thumb tacks, bones and rusty pipes
If you can squeeze between the bars
Enjoy my space employ my waste
And change the hand dealt by a stolen grace
Do you ever wish the circle was a square
So when land sharks start circling the borders
You could just cut them off at the corners
There's a ghost in the basket of values
Pertinent to, which kayak pilot succeeded in serving him proof
Now I'm surfing it through
So if you need me spread your wings to spell my name
Above the mess near the other funny requests
See mild to tolerant mannerisms of higher to win
To assist in a meticulous pick a part of cobweb of skins
Of innocence
A child of timid instinct with that ten step ahead premise
Supply dust bowls before the zephyr was requested
Violent humble shoes ten shades of blues come off the difference
I grimace, took me one hours blink to conclude that sickly innocence
My name is Dry spell
My name is pillar
My name's allegiance
My name is flagrant
My name's a thousand steps from patience

I hit it all day, all night, all afternoon
Rock all mics from the days of sassoon
Where the hell was you? On the corner with rats
When we was at the LQ, lockin it down and that was that
Divine speaker, mind keeper, time teacher, time leader
I'll be sittin' in the club by the speaker
Waitin for you rappers to choke up then I eat ya
Like some prehistoric winged creature, Ah!
On your neck, like the American eagle facin East and West
I be the best, Blastmaster KRS cause

We get 'em up
Uh, yo, we get 'em up
Like, Yeah, I SEE IT OVER THERE
I see it over there, it's... yeah it's over here!

Yeah, yeah, we get it

Here come the hard rock bump through the speaker top.
The tweeter meter blew code def hones in.
I pack a lunchbox, walk to the stoning,
Jump into the chemicals sold in my zoning.
I'm irrational, paranoid, tragic.
And the button on my chest says 'panic'.
Punch it, hold up, don't touch me.
I'm a savage from a rabid ass country.

You all acquitted.
You need to quit it.
Getting evicted, you little idiot, pitching tickets.
It's sorta tricky the way you wanna go get your digits.
Body you up at the party, somebody get his mistress.

Aesop Rock

You take a pitch black lung and a purple heart,
Then you kick back once the inertia start.
And when the shipwreck sunk through the perfect dark,
The serpent's arch alerts every circled shark.
See, bloody salt water sounds the h'ors d'oeuvres alarm,
And when the first arm's found we observe the art.
Like a belly-acher won't kick face to the curb,
Rather kick when the face already raped by the worms.

And when you in the streets you should peep the sets of strangers.
The actors that are in fact a cast of chaos.
They be looking for any situation they can play on.

When you take 2 to the vein, introduce 2 to the brain.
You don't get used to the pain. A maniac bruising the cage.
When cats rush you in the public you be like 'do it again'.
He's a motherfucking bloodsucker, he can do what he can.

El-P

On the side of the block, do the bus stop.
You paying a fare?
That's a trust fund.
Little ugly ass duck, life's a fun fuck.
Too battered to rush, I walk punch drunk.
And the whole world is yours now.
Before the steppers are goosed kick your door down.
I'm in the getaway whip with Aes Rizzle.
He got the same shit stitched in his missles.

And I miss you,
Even here taking it all in.
The sand, silvered, carries the moon
On it's shoulders.
Is it possible to put this night to tune
And move it to you?

Don't cry, I'll bring this home to you
If I can make this night light enough to move.

Cargo ships move by
Tracing on the horizon line.
There's a luster from the city lights
On the waves that kiss our feet
And we're thinking of going in,
The time's getting thin.

Don't cry, I'll bring this home to you
If I can make this night light enough to move.
Don't cry, I'll bring this home to you
If I can make this, If I can make this
Don't cry, I'll bring this home to you
If I can make this night light enough to move.
Don't cry, I'll bring this home to you

This is a city for not sleeping
And the clocks are set by feel.
At this moment from where I sit,
None of it seems real.

Don't cry, I'll bring this home to you
If I can make this night light enough to move.
Don't cry, I'll bring this home to you
If I can make this night light enough to move

andava in giro suonando il clarino
e si ubriacava quasi tutte le sere
mostrava sempre una sua vecchia ferita
avuta in cambio di una carta truccata
in una notte di stelle lontane
con la luna che stava a guardare

Lo diceva mia madre
che col fuoco non si deva scherzare
lo ripeteva mio padre
quando sentiva che volevo provare

una camicia e una giacca stirata
un indirizzo scritto a stampatello
e un nome da dire al cancello

E il vecchio greco che stava alla porta
ci ha provato a mettermi in guardia
ma io gli ho detto di stare a vedere
e l'ho deriso per il suo stupore

guarda sorniona la mia mossa furtiva
infilo gli assi senza farmi beccare,
fanculo al mondo fatemi respirare

There'll be nothing 
Left to realize
But does it matter do 
They know they left its lies

Seeing everything go
End of all things
And life as we know it
Shift your point of view
You've been warned
This one way ticket is for you

When all that's left is lies
We'll see nothing 
Left to realize
But does it matter do 
They know they left its lies

Seeing everything go
End of all things
The life, that we know
Shift your point of view
You've been warned
This one way ticket is for you

But what happens every day
We lead thousands of creatures to the slaughter it is like the entrance in hell
My thoughts gave my actions a battle and that's why I am here
To give another battle to the ones who destroy the creation
With humility I fall to my knees and pray for forgiveness
But the immortal souls of the dead give rise to a demon
That demon and his army of undead warriors prepare for reprisal
And they will beat us with our own weapons
Which means harm cruelty and death
But we shall not cry we deserve to be punished
And I will die with a smile on my face...

She was everything I dreamed she'd be

Spinning my head around and taking my body under

It was all there to see
Then your face caught up with your psychology
With a mouth full of teeth
You ate all your friends
And you broke every heart thinking ""every heart mends""

And in your town, no telling where you might see us

Out, doin' their damn thing like beavers
Yo, its P to the H-O, I finish the job
Plus my Dominican Broad
Making me chili con queso

Work and plan a perfect verse
Then burst like a person
That jerked from a circus cannon
Then landed to the earth
It's me on the song, featured your fleet
Breathing is strong
It's a gypsy reading a palm
With a drawn heater
Never gone of the wrong reefer
A bong chief, of the don ballest
As long as the bronze is bronze sneakers
Got ways of a thuggie, thinking I won't come and get you
Dressed like a gun with pistols, and AK's in a bundle

And Tay is blazing it lovely, 'cause I'm one with the game
So I sat back, chilled, dropped Foreign Exchange
And a lot of rap niggaz got lost
Heard Phontigga carrying tunes and assumed he don got soft
They didn't understand it was my next direction
So I'm playing postman and addressing questions
Like, yes I'm still a LB, no I'm not leaving
No I don't eat meat, but yes I'm still beefin
But all these wack niggaz putting records out

We realize how small we are
If they could love like you and me
Imagine what the world could be

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died

It was building up and no one was watching 
We're running out of darkened corners to sweep the waste into 
In our distracted focus no one had a chance 
When we lined up at the edge, we were open wide 
Like fools waiting for a sign 
It was a free fall 
An act of desperation, our backs against the wall 
It was a free fall 
It was an act of desperation 
Down we go 
As we all went blind, like an answer to the call of an outstretched hand 
The hell we beckoned crept inside 
The vultures circling overhead, starving to pick the skeletons we leave 
On the eve of the end as the world around us burns (the ashes shall rain) 
Somehow we still beg, give us a sign 
Dawn brings revenge 
Patience won't mend the broken 
Promise of something greater 
The cables wrapped around our throat, tonight pitch red cast over 
Senses adrift, I lay me down 
Plague wraps it's arms around me 
Down we go 
It was a free fall 
An act of desperation, our backs against the wall 
It was a free fall 
It was an act of desperation 
Down we go

Oh, how I smiled then, waiting so patiently
I'd make a wish and bleed

Soft creatures draped in white, light kisses gracing me
I can remember when I first realized
Dreams were the only place to see them

About grinning in the rear view mirror
Without your fake teeth in?
Keep your glass eye glued on the end of the highway up ahead of us.

You weren't supposed to open the door.
Just keep the plane from drifting off course.
We'll attend to the terrified first class
Convinced there's a hoof print on the bow.

All hail the wounded heart continment
Who've given us something more than faultlessness to sing about.
Long live prosthetic live wires.
The faulty mechanism of hope has disintegrated.

Your captain nailed his feet to someone else's ship at the sight of me.

Do what your mother tells you and put down the sheriff's horse.
The choir on the black box rejoiced splendidly,
Singing hallelujah the king is dead.

The God above for making me the man that I am

It feels like - It's foolish everywhere
It seems like - It's crucial everywhere
I never thought I could be stappled
By the metal in the gun
I never thought I could be stappled
By the metal in the gun

It might be you - It might be me
It might be you
I'm Blown Away
I'm Blown Away

It might be you - It might be you
It might be you
I'm Blown
Away
