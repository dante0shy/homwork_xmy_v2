0,"(It is the belief of Marx that the personal is dead; that all is the political. Throughout history this can be seen as true; that the choices we make every day influence and shape the world around us. Edmund Bruce wrote in his book Reflections that government preyed on the basest instincts found in man; the fear of death and the desire to make money. Bruce found that government did not do anything to promote any ideals or values; all that was left was death and taxes (the often cited ""only sure things"") and people were left empty and suspicious of one another. Imagine the American citizenry as a group of rats squabbling over refuse found in a garbage, fighting viciously fighting with one another over that one piece of rancid cheese, while the real rats (big business, government) sit in their great halls and eat their pounds of flesh. This distrust and fear of each other has permeated every aspect of American life. A stranger is treated with fear and distrust at best, and outright hostility at worst. The media fosters this distrust by airing and reporting the most brutal sensationalized stories possible. The American citizen must learn to trust their fellow man again and realize whom the real criminals are.)

""I create my own. I no longer revolve. around your resentment. I can smell the hatred behind your tearing sneer. I am no longer threatened by this judgment throne. lies. dead. stagnant. change. forgetting one more day. I could really care less about your lame confinement. my ego's not worth saving when true change is not met. forgetting one last day. I can't understand. but I feel this rage is spreading on inside me. you tread on me like you have before. my body is broke but my soul's unbowed. your laughter fuels a will to move inside of me that I've never felt. standing, grabbing ground. your faces all drown out. I can't understand but I can't stop forward moving. I won't be pulled down anymore this is all I have no matter what scorn. ears sliced off by complacency do their bodies no good for the words they speak. you tried your best to take me down and then explained that's what friends are for. your ruled me out. you ruled me out.""

1,"All the pieces fall into place
When we walk these fields
And I reach out and touch your face
This earthly heaven is enough for me

So break the bread and pour the wine
I need no blessings but I'm counting mine
Life is much more than money buys
When I see the faith in my children's eyes

I've felt the power in a holy place
And wished for comfort when in need
Now I'm here in a state of grace
This earthly heaven is enough for me

So break the bread and pour the wine
I need no blessings but I'm counting mine
Life is much more than money buys
When I see the faith in my children's eyes

So break the bread and pour the wine
I need no blessings but I'm counting mine
Life is much more than money buys
When I see the faith in my children's eyes

(Krayzie)

'Cause I'm tellin' y'all right now I'm smokin' everything I'm spendin
Goin' down, cop a quarter pound now we in here blowin' it
Wait a minute where's the bowl at?
Young Dre done got me spoiled man
Done smoked two blunts, and now I'm feelin' like I can fly
I get into zones of my own every time I get high
And whenever it is, I think I see
I'm buzzin so it doesn't really matter to me

(LaReece)
I got issues nuttin but problems feels my green
My nigga wanna test me with the same old games
Got this chicken down in San Diego, and he trickin on my pesos
And he think that I don't know
And he got the gawl he fuckin' two of my dawgz
Now they actin' kinda funny when I call
So when I'm with my Thugs On Da Line
Tonight no lady like instead I grab a fifth of Hen
Take it to the head, c'mon

(Asu)
Now, niggaz came late to get me Keith G pass me the Henny

It ain't easy being me, but nobody could do it better

(Boss)
Everytime I'm rollin' out with Krayzie we crazy, try not to get ciffed up
Fucked up sippin on that siz rup, pourin out that cup of stuff
Them jolly ranchees and enhancers, I mix it up like a chemist
Drop about 10 of 'em in it, then sip it slow till it's finished
Then it's that (??) little (?) is safe at home
Then get your brain broke, they boiler makers and they chain smoke
Boss ain't no fuckin' rookiem put purple permethozine up on you ream
That's guaranteed to make you lean and keep you higher than girffe pussy

(Kieth G)
I ain't ate all day, but steadily gettin' fucked up
Smokin' this weed, waitin to get scooped up
It's the bum Keith G, carribus we on twists
We needed a fix, my nigga dip into the rent
We worry about that payback later we gonna smoke
And live for the meanwhile puffin with Juvenile, what?

You're all the hope the reason that I live
I believe in you just because I don't need no one to prove your love
From all that I have seen
It's easier for me to believe in you - oh no yeah

You are so beautiful
You are the miracle

You had everything
You were there for me
There to see me through

The clock is ticking and my shelf life is up
The clock is ticking and my shelf life is up

Wrong side of the tracks, wrong side of the fence
Wrong thing that I lack, I lack the common sense
My life
And this is all I know
And I've got no time
I've got no mind
I've got nowhere to go

Can't live in your world of the 9, 9 to 5
You'll get your 15 minutes and I've got my whole life
My life
And this is all I know
And I've got no time
I've got no mind
I've got nowhere to go

Career tests all came back inconclusive
All that I can give is a half assed attempt
At being like you, I'm not normal like you
Nothing I can say, I haven't said 5,000 times
'Cause you've got your way to live and I've got mine
There's nothing to say, I've said it 15,000 times
Kiss it goodnight, kiss me goodbye

You think it never hurt, all the con, confusion
All the itches in my nerves, all the hate in my blood
My blood
This isn't what I need
Occupational conformity won't put my mind at ease, so

The clock is ticking and my shelf life is up
And all bets have been placed for when the wheel's gonna stop
So stop
Cause this what I need
This is life
And this is love
And this is my release (yeah)

Pains my soul to separate like this
I guess that's how it is, I'll leave myself to mine
Our paths can't cross now, I wish I had one more chance now

Nothing I can say that I haven't said 5,000 times
You've got your way to live and I've got mine
There's nothing to say, I've said it 15,000 times
Kiss it goodnight, kiss me goodbye

It's been a year or two since we've communicated
So don't tell me you're one for me to trust or believe in
I believe nothing, I will not trust anyone again
Anyone again

I've said it 15,000 times

My brain keeps spinning and I still can't give up
I've run far off the course, I guess I'm never gonna stop
This clock's keeps ticking, sorry I got no more shelf life for ya baby
Time bomb's ticking, I'll commence blowing up
I'll construe your rejection as a lack of trust

You won't love me
Once I'm washed up
I'm all washed up, yeah
And I can't trust no one

There's nothing I can say, I haven't said 5,000 times
You've got your way to live and I've got mine (yeah, yeah, I've got mine, yeah)
There's nothing to say, I've said it 15,000 times

What you say, what you did
Do, what you do, put your hand on my head

Sometimes life can be a burden
Trying to stay one step ahead
I feel the world upon my shoulder
Each time I'm standing out on the edge
My hopes have all deserted me
Like their washed away in the sand
And it's hurting my pride, trying to survive
But I know that I stand a chance when you lay your hands, oh yeah

'Cause it's the only thing I have that still makes sense

Oh baby when I'm calling out, give me love and affection
Keep telling me, showing me the way
Oh, If you see me falling down, lift me up from the shadows
Will you take me away to a better place
And when I'm in my darkest hour I need you by my side
To turn the tide till the suffering ebs
Life is getting me down, getting me down close to defeat
Come and lay your hands on me

Do, what you do
What you say, what you did
Do what you do, put your hand on my head

Feel this road is getting longer now and I'm too far away from home
Still I've gotta keep on moving on but I can't do it on my own (not without you baby)
Baby keeping me head above the water, help me swim from my life
Because the game is getting the harder, the strain is getting stronger
And I can only face the fight when you lay your hands

Do, what you do
What you Say, what you did
Do what you do, put your hand on my head

Oh yeah

'Cause it's the only thing I have that still makes sense

Oh baby when I'm calling out, give me love and affection
Keep telling me, showing me the way

Come and lay your hands on me

Do, what you do
Till I'm healed again
Do, what you do
What you Say, what you did
Rediscovered my strength
Do, what you do
Those bitter blues are gone
Do, what you do

All gone
Feel the pain
Feel the strain
I'm falling
Lay your hands on

Oh baby when I'm calling out, give me love and affection
Keep telling me, showing me the way
Oh, If you see me falling down, lift me up from the shadows
Will you take me away to a better place
And when I'm in my darkest hour I need you by my side

Some things will never change

Mankind remains the same

Oceans
Forests
Nations
Now everything bears our name
While Earth is bleeding
Nothing will remain
Nothing prevails

We were stuck in this world of change
Expecting it to remain
Now nothing is left unstained

No!

When there's nothing more that we can trade
Own
Steal
Or sell

When there's nothing whole because we took it apart
And
Just left
Moved on

When there's nothing left for us to break
Use
Abuse
Or rape

Then you're free to count how much you saved

<b>Radio reports</b>
Power grids shut down today ranging from the east coast all the way to Michigan and parts of Canada
A total of 50 million people are without power
There is no estimate of when the electricity will be restored and the cause is yet unknown
New York city is in gridlock with hundreds of thousands of people in the streets
Their cars left on the sides of the road

Terrible earthquakes rocked Samoa, the ?
It rated 7.2 on the richer scale
At this point no estimates of deceased and wounded can be recorded
We do know however that since the year 1973
There have been 17 earthquakes in 14 cities
Throughout Europe
With 6,500 dead

Two tankers collided off the coast of Norway
This afternoon pouring millions of gallons of oil into the ocean
???? Is going to have a terrific effect on the ocean for years to come
The greatest fear being the extinction of several species ??? on the ""endangered"" list

I can see the ways we fail
I can see us fall so easily
A structure far too frail
I can see 40,000 years of knowledge and history
Invested in this child
Spoiled and stained by proud divinity
Gaining at best the perspective and wisdom
Of not even a fleeting century

We have now reached the final ten thousandth of a second
Of our evolutionary year, as we hit 2,000 at a birth rate
Of 250 people a minute

Tell me
How are we supposed to survive?
If we're acting like fools
All dropping dead to stay alive?
Someone tell me
Please just show me
If there's nothing to do, God we'll turn to you
But if we're an image of you
I reckon you are just as puzzled and ugly too

You think we have developed fast; that we're civilized and intelligent
I'll let you in on a secret: we have developed Things!
The rest is simply knowledge passed on

(I can see us drain this world
I can see us buying loss too cheap
Terra Sterilia washing its broken hand of us now
Creation's blackest sheep!)
Hell, 99% of humanity couldn't put together a simple light bulb if you put a gun to their heads!
And the intellect rubs off on fear

The year 2,010 AD: 6,823 Million people
2,020 AD: 7,518 Million people
2,030 AD: 8,140 Million people
2,040 AD: 8,668 Million people
2,050 AD: 9,104 Million people

I can see us read the signs
But spell them out in backward travesty
I see us close our eyes
To all the wounds that we inflict to this world by being ""free""
We love this world to death
Purchasing our lifestyles with our lives
Defending our momentarily nations
With the loss of our priceless earthly home

It's not hard to reach the top
It's not hard not knowing when to stop
It's not hard to take all
Not very difficult to fly if you settle for a fall
It's not hard to cross a line
It's not hard to push and go too far
Some creatures cannot climb
Then there are us who cannot even learn how to stay alive

I'm sorry!
For the things we did and did not do
Forgive us; the fools that rushed ahead without a clue
I am sorry
Please forgive us
For this human lack of humanity
This evolutionary travesty
This tragedy called ""Man""
...Called ""Man""...

In the stories told?
To you by my friends and I
When you were four years old?

How it got so cold that words just froze
We had to wait till summer
To find out what was said
One of the best times that we had

I know I say that I'm just fine
But I hope you wonder from time to time

I was nervous from the start that our muscles might tear us apart
Are muscles tearing us apart?
From the words that carve our lives to the words that take us by surprise
I was never taken by surprise

From the sounds that disappear to the changes we begin to fear
I can hear you clearly
One day I'll fail to breathe and all you'll have are memories
All we have are memories

15,"Turn the key to the night 
See it pulling outta here
See if the stars know where you go
Follow the dark across
There's a purpose for you there
Follow the first impression home

Reckless and cold
Never been sold on someone to call your own
Reckless and cold
It's the first time you've had it all

And now you're running out of time
Running out of time to draw the line
You heard the world was moving on
World was moving on with you a step behind
And now you're running out of time, running out of time 
Your life flashes before your eyes

Demons are at your door
Phantoms inching ever close
Evil is starved for innocence
So far from typical 
To need a friend, to need a friend
You better hold on to that younger heart

Reckless and cold
Never been sold on someone to call your own
Reckless and cold
It's the first time you've had it all

And now you're running out of time
Running out of time to draw the line
You heard the world was moving on
World was moving on with you a step behind
And now you're running out of time, running out of time
Your life flashes before your eyes

(So far from typical)
Reckless and cold
Never been sold on someone to call your own
(So far from typical)
Reckless and cold 
It's the first time you've had it all
(So now you dance to the beat of the breakdown)

And now you're running out of time
Running out of time to draw the line
You heard the world was moving on
World was moving on with you a step behind
And now you're running out of time, running out of time
Your life flashes before your eyes

And now you're running out of time, running out of time
Your life flashes before my eyes

Yeah!

Running out of time (x10)
Running out of time, time, time, time

16,"You shout in your sleep
Perhaps the price is just too steep
Is your conscious at rest
If once put to the test
You awake with a start
To just the beating of your heart
Just one man beneath the sky
Just two ears just two eyes

You set sail across the sea
Of long past thoughts and memories
Childhood's end your fantasies
Merge with harsh realities
And then as the sail is hoist
You find your eyes are growing moist
And all the fears never voiced
Say you have to make the final choice

Who are you and who am I
To say we know the reason why?
Some are born some men die
Beneath one infinite sky
There'll be war there'll be peace
But everything one day will cease
All the iron turn to rust
All the proud men turn to dust
So all things time will mend
And so this song will end

17,"Face those facts, you can't relax
You gotta get that train back on its tracks
Till the morning comes
The work is done
Find your place beneath the sun

Rake those leaves as thick as thieves
Then go and put your heart back on its sleeve
Till September rain
And all its pain
Dies in vain

And I know what you're thinking
The world is shrinking in your bones...

Dies ""Laber-drum-herum""
Moralgetr&#228;nkt und abgestanden
Und keiner wei&#223;, wohin und warum
Doch wenn ihr lest ""Staatskarosse flog in die Luft""
Mit zwei Herren oder drei
Dann k&#246;nnt ihr euch sicher sein:
Ich war dabei

Ich geh' kaum noch auf eine Demo
Um die Ohnmacht nicht zu sp&#252;ren
Hab' weder Lust auf das Getrotte
Noch Schergenkn&#252;ppel auf meiner Haut zu sp&#252;ren
Doch wenn ihr h&#246;rt, letzte Nacht
Wurden 200 Wannen plattgemacht
ich sag's ganz ehrlich, offen und frei:
Ich war dabei

Ich hab' meine Fahne aufgerollt
Sie liegt oben auf meinem Speicher
Und wenn ich dran denk', was ich damals verdiente
Mu&#223; ich sagen: heut' bin ich reicher
Doch wenn ihr h&#246;rt, da&#223; ein Chemiekonzern
Ziel eines ohrenbet&#228;ubenden Anschlags sei
Nun, eigentlich wollte ich es f&#252;r mich behalten
Doch euch sag' ich's:
Ich war dabei

Hin und wieder schau' ich Fernsehen
Hab' ne Zeitung abonniert
Manchmal stapelt sie sich ungelesen
Und es ist mir egal, was passiert
Doch wenn ihr h&#246;rt, einen alten Schl&#228;chter
Pumpten sie heut' morgen voller Blei
Viele Leute w&#252;rden das Gegenteil beschw&#246;ren, doch:
Ich war dabei

Oft war ich versucht, mich aus vielem rauszuhalten
La&#223;' die Finger von dieser ganzen Schweinerei
Es hat nicht hingehauen
&#220;berall, zu jeder Zeit, was es auch sei
Ich, ich war dabei - ich, ich war dabei
Ich, ich war dabei

To believe in In your arms

Painted when you touch me
Heaven when you hold me

I'm not asking for much Next to your beautiful skin
To believe in I can feel it
You're not leaving In your arms

Close my eyes, so I can see
Your love, the light that shines on

Oh, how you take my breath away
When you fall like rain and surround me

Baby, don't let go
Spirit, don't let go
Let me stay in your arms
I'm not asking for much
But to lay me down
Why don't you set me down
Let me hide in your arms
Let me breathe, close my eyes
Let me see, pour your love on me
Oh, how you take my breath away

I want so much to open your eyes 
'Cause I need you to look into mine 

Tell me that you'll open your eyes
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
Tell me that you'll open your eyes

'Cause they don't get your soul or your fire 
Take my hand, knot your fingers through mine 
And we'll walk from this dark room for the last time 

Every minute from this minute now

22,"There's some things that I regret
Some words I wish had gone unsaid
Some starts that had some better endings
Been some bad times I've been through
Damage I could not undo
Some things I wish I could do all all over again
But it don't really matter
When life gets that much harder
It makes you that much stronger
Oh
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned

From every tear that had to fall from my eyes
From every day I wondered how I'd get through the night
From every change life has thrown me
I'm thankful for every break in my heart
I'm grateful for every scar
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned

There's mistakes that I have made
Some chances I just threw away
Some roads I never should've taken
Been some signs I didn't see
Hearts that I hurt needlessly
Some wounds that I wish I could have one more chance to mend
But it don't make no difference
The past can't be rewritten
You get the life you're given
Oh
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned

From every tear that had to fall from my eyes
From every day I wondered how I'd get through the night
From every change life has thrown me
I'm thankful for every break in my heart
I'm grateful for every scar
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned

And all the things that break you
Are all the things that make you strong
You can't change the past 'cause it's gone
And you gotta just move on
Because it's all
Lessons learned

From every tear that had to fall from my eyes
From every day I wondered how I'd get through the night
From every change life has thrown me
I'm thankful for every break in my heart
I'm grateful for every scar
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned

Lessons learned

Some pages turned
Some bridges burned

Take me to the ocean, take me to the sea
Take me to the Breathe and BE

Autumn came with knowledge, came with ego came with pride
Autumn came with shamefulness for the things we could not hide
Winter came with anger and a bitter taste of fate
Winter came with fear for the things we could not escape

Take me to the forest, take me to the trees
Take me anywhere as long as you take me
Take me to the ocean, take me to the sea

And nine digit zip codes
Secret decoder ring codes
Arteries, shopping nodes

We'll invent some new computers
Link up the global village
And get AP, UPI, Reuters
To tell everybody the news

We'll be one happy neighborhood
Spread out across the world
Who's going to stop that burglar
From breaking into my house
If he lives that far away

We'll be just like old friends
No means to your ends
The police state is too busy
And the neighborhood's getting out of hand

Big Brother on every wall
Muzak plays in all the halls
Empires see the rise and fall
They divide, conquer

It's not about my politics
Something happened way too quick
Bunch of men who played it sick
They divide, conquer

It's all here before your eyes
Safety is a big disguise
That hides among the other lies
They divide, conquer

Well, I expect I won't be heard
'Cause my silence is assured
Never a discouraging word
They divide, conquer

They divide and conquer
Divide and conquer
They divide and conquer
Divide and conquer

Divide and conquer
And conquer

It's not easy singing sad songs

Than to spend the summer crying
Now summer cannot come anyway

I had waited for time to change her
The only change that came was over me
She pretended not to want love
I hope she was only fooling me

So when you look into the sun
Look for the pleasures nearly won
Or was it better then to run
Than to spend the summer singing
And summer could have come in a day

So if you hear my sad song singing
Remember who and what you nearly had
It's not easy singing sad songs
When you can sing the song to make me glad

So when you look into the sun
And see the words you could have sung
It's not too late, only begun

Hit after hit, every record is the same
Still getting mine out here in the rap game
Not a black Caesar, more like a black Pharoh
The gorilla killa devil in a double barrel
Uh, sawed off and hauled off here I come again
Peace to all my people in the pen, 'cause Ren
Will keep all my shit comin' phat
So whack fools take this it's like that

Yeah, it's like that nigga
Yeah, it's like that nigga
Hell yeah It's like that nigga

Say what? It's like that nigga
You know it's like that nigga
Yeah, let them playa hatin' fools know the real, how you feel
It's like that nigga
Damn, it's like that nigga
Say what? It's like that nigga

30,"No use crying over spilt milk
I bring her flowers and we watch them wilt
Naturally built there's nothing store bought
I ought to thank her folks for what she's got
Sex oozes from her every pore
So many butterflies my guts are sore
And even before she opens up her mouth
I know what she's thinking about

She fits like a glove
She's as pure as a dove
She's sent from above
She's all I think of

She's lovely
She's all I think of
She's lovely

She's gorgeous
She goes against the grain
Extravaganza tastes like sugar cane
We got big plans whatever she chooses
Fky her to Hawaii maybe some cruses
I'll explain it's plain and simple
She's like the cherry in a Shirley Temple
She's the prize at the bottom of the glass
Her eyes are the way she shakes that ass

She fits like a glove
She's as pure as a dove
She's sent from above
She's all I think of

She's lovely
She's all I think of
She's lovely

She makes the sun come up and the moon go down
She the one that makes my world go round
Body like an hourglass
She'll make time stop just to make the night last
She's the one that knows my secret spot
She'll make the coldest nights feel so hot
She ain't into material things
But she's the one that shows me what lovely means

She's lovely
She's all I think of
She's lovely

Yeah motherfucker... that's right...
The motherfucker in the house... Kool Keith...
Fuck all the bullshit, let's get to the real shit...
Yeah...

Your rhyme touch is soft kid
Like a stripper's ass with a touch of plastic
Writin with a local style
Talkin' about competitive shit you never mastered
Youse a wannabe thug nigga, you ain't bugged nigga
I cut your bitch-ass up, leave your legs under the rug nigga
Who want the whiplash?
Cigarette burns, broken face hair pinned up in a cast
Me standin on the top of your tour bus
Butt-naked with a fuckin' hockey mask
Slicin your cashmere with a sharp 7-Up glass
Don't you know I'm sick nigga? Lick my dick nigga!
Forty-four caliber killer gun-toter
Hide your kneecaps in a Lexus motor
Pack your stomach in a compartment
Old dingy fucked up Bronx apartment
Don't piss me off with a tec-9 loaded in a bullshit street argument
I don't care how hard you get
You just another man that never lived in the projects poppin' shit
You ain't stoppin' shit, fuck that Batman and Robin shit
And what block you with
Kneel down, make a nigga like you call me Big Ernest
Bake your intestines, throw your stomach in the furnace
Watch the thermostat, you ain't no fuckin' fat cat

Chorus: Kool Keith

[Sung] You never lived in the projects!
You ain't no drug dealer

(Kool Keith)
Rude bwoy with a temper like a Jamaican off a Haitian boat
Caribbean ruckus - with an Elvis wig
Slap the piss out of one of you untalented rap motherfuckers
Bodyguards won't work
With a 30-shot car bomb under my Dominican shirt
Submachine in the duffle bag
Watchin Sesame Street with my daughter, peepin Ernie and Bert
With backstage passes, wearin a long trenchcoat
Get Morris in your projects
And Jackson in a Madison Square Garden concert
Ready for CBS and NBC, to do a big network
The average guy, havin' a product manager
And a female publicist wearin a fuckin' bulletproof vest
I got time for motherfuckers actin' like Elliot Ness
Winchester sawed off blow your Rolex through your fuckin' chest
Splatted body pieces while blood drips off your girl's dress
I'm ready for more progress
Have your head sent home
And a piece of your leg sittin' on the record company desk
Extort like a mad nigga Western Union
You don't have a clue men how I get through men

Would you look into my eyes?
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Could you tell me what you see?

Comin' through the door with my militia, why did he bring big niggas?
Fuck y'all, with a gang of bodyguards
My niggas is stone cold killas, peelas
Dippin' off in limos the bitch, y'all just maintain
Givin' my babies all of my money, but my diamonds steady be shinin'
My gang, you know me. Homies got mo' love
And I'm blessed, when I'm outta my sentence
'Cause I'm Mr. Mo' Thug, gotta keep the Lord up over my shoulders
Jesus sent me his roll of loco, sober, load a revolver, hold up
Now, buck 'em all to Hell, 'cause I'm showin' 'em
And I seen that the bulletholes was too much, no luck
Ya get blowed up, all of you niggas goes out
The surgeons say that your body can not be sewed up
Hold up, and wait a minute
It's time for Bone Thugs, 'cause y'all think that you can really hate,

(Krayzie)
What makes a nigga think he can bite my shit and call his shit original?
What's worse, tellin' people you made the style we put down three fuckin'
Years ago
And that's just like a nigga wanna take all the credit
I bet it didn't even occur that we would eventually meet with ya, kid
Don't crash, collide, lock up with the enemy
And I don't wanna say a nigga's name and all that
But a y'all fin to get stomped, let 'em loose
And they heard the news, ya run up, ya could get dead, oh
Uh-huh, hey, we murder muthafuckas in a deadly way -
Fully automatic when we let 'em lay
""Aw shit! Get down, Leatherface.""
Fuck 'em all, if I can't get my respect
Come on, now, put them to rest
A bloody, bloody mess, but nevertheless, we won't stress
I figured this platinum got you actin' like you got to be me
It's all in your mind, but in time, you'll find we as real as we speak

(Layzie)
All I see is this soldier, pistol in holster, givin' you the most
I toast to them thugs
Nigga, nothin' but the love of bud that we brought to the table
And a nigga wanna test, catch slugs, put 'em in the mud
Harmony smooth with the thug shit, mo murda to the fools that clone
Five niggas loc'd out with the roughness, nigga
And it's war when you craft these Bones we can get it on
And I'm referrin' to all of y'all bitches
Y'all know who y'all are when y'all tried that
Rollin' with the E since ninety-three, shuttin'
Shit down in the industry, nigga, can you bite that?
I know y'all niggas wanna roll with pros, and make friend of foes
But we chosen - God done blessed us with His potion
Pure devotion, freely spoken, baby
Niggas can't see us never, stay together, my click too clever
Ridin' through the days of the stormy weather
Remember: eternal, it means for everlastin'
#1 Assassin blastin', bashin' on all you niggas's what I'm doin'
All of the heavens gonna be rulin' trues, when He come
We won't be losin', provin' 'em wrong

(Wish)
I see five killa realer niggas ready to roll wherever I go
True to pull the trigger, smother a nigga, put 'em in a river
We the killas, and that's for sure
Niggas out there clownin' mine, you can't rhyme, the style you got is all mine
And when I see you, bitch, I'm goin' in your pockets double-time
And it's like that, you don't want that
Come and get some pap, pap. Wanna sound like?
Wanna be like? Nigga, we can't have that
Why a nigga wanna bite the Bone shit? Platinum raps
Nigga bet that bitin' shit ain't doin' nothin', tryin' to make somethin'
Outta nothin'
Fuck it, let's peel caps, buck 'em all down
Put 'em in check, fuck 'em up with the 44 mag, I'm glad
'Cause when you're fuckin' with Bone, we sendin' 'em home in a bodybag
Now, look into my eyes, bet you see a realer killa thug puttin' it down with

And you may struggle with pain and loss sometimes
But as long as you are humble
And you stay true inside

Mountains will make it harder
Dark clouds will make you doubt
But you'll get through

This ray of hope I give to you

Loaded clip, folded sticks, my lifts and double cuffed up
Put my stick so nigga feel my pockets with the dollar
'Cause they rock keep the stock in a private prison parlor
Grinch you did it, your black ass really did it
Give Bone the microphone and let him kill it
Give Bone the microphone and watch me beat you like a cop
Lil' G from the hall so the maggot won't stop
And plus I'm packin' punches always keep a good grip
My homies call me Bone from the Whole Damn Click
I live like a mack and keep the bitches on my dick
You sorry sap sips still hangin' on my shit
Compton is the heart and that's where we all from
The jackin' goin' on in the hood and in the slum
And don't be caught slippin' while we dippin' the 4
'Cause Ren'll grab his nine and watch him smoke 'em from the door
And then we make a dash and put that ass in the air
True checkin' done by the true fuckin' player
I'm headed to the cut with straight chronic in my pock
Rainin' make 'em kill 'em 'cause I'm servin' 'em spot
And that's how it's done I keep it flowin' like a sailor
My beats are large my feats are star, some called me Chuck Taylor
Then I call the Juvy 'cause I know we gotta Coupe
Don't worry 'bout a damn we got the end, we gettin' loot

Then call me Mr. Dopeman when I'm chillin' in the spot
My niggaz call me Bishop when I'm rollin' with my glock
The crackers call me bandit when I'm runnin' from the cops
And the bitches call me daddy when I'm tearin' up the cock
Yo the title's Mr. Fuck up so I figure that I'm fucked
Got no luck, shit, gotta go and earn a quick buck
Boom boom, is the sound of my cannon
'Cause I'm a nigga with a motherfuckin' gun master plannin'
I'm a crazy ass nigga makin' motherfuckers fall
A nigga from the streets hangin' in the fuckin' hall
I place where we smoke bud and niggaz get bent
And when it comes to music put on MC Ren shit
Now everybody chillin' and the bitches gettin' freaky
Took a trick to the room now she gots ta lick me
Lickin' out my ass hole like a fuckin' groupie
I'm through now I cleans up and call my nigga Juvy
Headin' downstairs my niggaz hand me a 4-O
Smokin' the extension you know it's the indo
Now I'm feelin' high like I'm sittin' on a cloud
The dust that we kick I guess we live our lives foul
Beware of the nigga that they call J-Rock
The party's goin' through but I still got my glock
I'm watchin' for the bad apples in every bunch
And if it's necessary motherfucker we can thump
Or get a fuckin' pump, put a hole in your chest
Slugs goin' straight through a bullet proof vest
Matters gettin' worse if I have to drop the dogs
Beat ya in your face yellin' till ya hit the hall
So smalls, get your fuckin' 9 and your clip
And let these motherfuckers know what's up on the Whole Click

35,"Is there any hope for us, or are the rumors true?
Are we just the mulch and kindling that accrues?
Can we recover from this?

I've seen expressions in department stores
I've smelled regression wafting up from these shores
This is not a celebration of slipping through some crack
This is sloth and devastation and we're the resulting trash

Count on your fingers tonight
Count on your fingers tonight
And believe what you find
I'm sick of making small talk in this rotting chow line

Recover, recover recover?
Can we recover, recover, recover?
Can we recover, recover, recover, recover?
We cover our heads and we run for the gutter

Toby Keith's horses and Toby Keith's men
Finally put us all in our place
It's a wonderful hug when there's so much more to love
When there's steaks and hearts jammed in your face

This is the fucking slop line
And we're scratching with our hooves
How much of evolution
Must we finally disprove?

Count on your fingers tonight
Count on your fingers tonight
And believe what you find
I don't believe what we find

Can we recover, recover, recover?
Can we recover, recover, recover?
Can we recover, recover, recover?
Can we recover, recover, recover?
We cover our heads and we run for the gutter

Dear Mother, I'm sorry
There was nowhere left to run
We fought and we fought until our bullets ran out
And they took us one by one

Dear Mother, I'm sorry
We had just barely begun
This will be the last letter from your only son
From your only son

Yeah I do not believe
Recover as one, recover as one
Recover as one, recover as one

I've got the field day jitters, wet matches and a bottle of Mr. Clean.
I'm a nervous wreck in the shape of a test.
I figure it's all about giving.
Causing all of the brain to slip into frame and visit the space that it gives me for sleep.

Wondering jets inside of me.
I've got the field day jitters.
I'm an open nest, a paper address.
I can get lost in just living.
Blowing thoughts of regret,
You'll never forget the feeling of falling and breaking.

This is me, your glue gun's dream.
A map of every road, a friend that drops his nose.
But this can't be -- I'm a cracking machine.
My will is to hold and my creed is to be the unbreakable me.
Now it's time to fill up all the cracks in me,
No stopping, no stopping, no stopping,
It's what I want, it's what I see,
That I'm unbreakable, capable, breakable.
Bye-bye, never any doubt in me...

37,"I ragazzi bevevano forte nell'angolo dell'orchestra
bevevano roba pesa e andavano fuori di testa
se ne stavano sopra il palco ad accordare gli strumenti
con le loro giacche scure e lo spino in mezzo ai denti

giravano per suonare ma pensavano solo a bere

Dammi un tre, dammi un tre, che la gente vuole ballare
le lucertole del folk adesso stanno per cominciare
versa qui, versa qui, versa un goccio e sentirai
le lucertole bevono forte ma non sbagliano quasi mai

C'&#232; Paolino alla chitarra che svisa con le mazurche
gli fumano le dita, sembra un treno quando parte
c'&#232; Wilmer con la fisa, detto anche il bolscevico
perch&#232; suona bandiera rossa appena vede un prete in giro
c'&#232; Caligola il cantante che non riesce mai a cantare
dopo il terzo whiskey sbraita come un animale

Dammi un tre...

Poi c'&#232; Sisto con il basso e quello &#232; un vero omone
si tromba tutte le donne e non chiede neanche il nome

I see her face
Through all these years
Just waiting
It all catches up to you when you slow down

I'm back in that yard
Tasting that shame
Of pushing her down
Of kids and her games
Their strongholds

We had a bigger world
We had a better view
I guess I never fully realized then
What she lost when I cut that loss

So she filled the void
With unearthly friends
Voices of hers
Greater

We had a bigger world
We had a better view
I wish she'd never told us about her voices
We were strong, we were much too strong

(Never forgive) No!
(Never forget) Never forget

We picked and pierced, we ripped and we tore
We hit and we scratched to make in her a hole
Glares and eyes, whispers and notes
Attached to her every pose

(We fed her shouts)
(For the collection of her voices)
(I was too weak to collect)
Their ugly truth
Outnumbered by far her beautiful dream
(But so it turned out)
And I closed my eyes
(Was she both paid in soul)
Were her eyes in yours already when we met?
(For the cutting of that loss)
Am I still paying debts to recover life?

Now I can see she proved to be right
As she was called down
It's sad though
That I turned out to be one of her voices

Of my savior
I will fear, I will fear
I will fear, pain no more

Someday, I will go home
Someday, I will go home
And I shall take the hand

Ya you spoil me with loyalty and true commitment

Your prey is dead
Died in silence

I'll forever stay with you
At your feet, I will kneel

When you rule, all is ruled by you
In your world, there is only you
In my world, there is only you

In your web
The threads entangle
At your will
Dead silent

Your words are shivers down my spine
I'm numb and shapeless in your web, in your web

The past is shattered forever

Or would your restlessness consume
Fading memories of me?

Fall into open arms that offer their protection
Quick to deny that they're open to deceit
Long to believe that support will never cease
Bitter and lonely, those they've left before

What I if could go to sleep for days?
Would you count the hours?

So quickly growing old
The warmest eyes
So quickly growing cold

And yeah, honey is more bounce to the ounce
She walks around with lucci in large amounts
Millions inside Swiss bank accounts
Her name is Tammy, got a beach house in Miami
Rides around with a small jammy in her silk and satin panties
A down hoe, a Foxy Brown hoe, standin her ground hoe
And if you clown yo she'll turn into a bust a round hoe
Fly as a Heaven's Angel got sapphires in her bangles
Diamond earrings hangin' dingle gettin' money from all angles
She's pretty under the New York city bright lights
And real light, way after midnight, I hit it cause the slit's tight
Wake up early and make my rounds, break up break down
Packin a silver four pound, some clowns be trying to get down
Light up a smoke and grab a stack of C-notes
Them slick stick up kids don't get no free dough bro
'Cause I ain't tryin' to be broke

Tempt me to change things because I've got the will and the blade
But my sins have cursed me

About the places he had been to
And the things that he had seen

A quiet voice is singing something to me
An age old song about the home of the brave
In this land here of the free
One time one night in America

A lady dressed in white with the man she loved
Standing along the side of their pickup truck
A shot rang out in the night
Just when everything seemed right
Another headline written down in America

The guy that lived next door in #305
Took the kids to the park and disappeared
About half past nine
Who will ever know
How much she loved them so
That dark night alone in America

A quiet voice is singing something to me
An age old song about the home of the brave
In this land here of the free
One time one night in America

Four small boys playing ball in a parking lot
A preacher, a teacher, and the other became a cop
A car skidded into the rain
Making the last little one a saint
One more light goes out in America

A young girl tosses a coin in the wishing well
She hopes for a heaven while for her
There's just this hell
She gave away her life
To become somebody's wife
Another wish unanswered in America

People having so much faith
Die too soon while all the rest come late
We write a song that no one sings
On a cold black stone
Where a lasting peace will finally bring

The sunlight plays upon my windowpane
I wake up to a world that's still the same
My father said to be strong
And that a good man could never do wrong
In a dream I had last night in America

A wise man was telling storie to me
About the places he had been to
And the things that he had seen

An age old song about the home of the brave

In this rap game I come, from the back of the pack
Now they respect my work, like I'm packing a mack
Everytime I sound check, I'm cracking the deck
On track split wigs, like a x in the hat
You know how I act in the Lac, I'm a hog

Texas boys crawl, like a nigga with his legs cut
K bullets hit niggas, and they edge up
Pay attention, focus nigga

Better have that on your mind, when you approach us nigga
A bitch'll jump fly, when they dose your hitter

I'm a gangsta, and I'm out of control
Drink wrecking ice cold, but my vaults on swoll
Pay the toll when you pass, it's the bill collector
Cocaine disector, come with Hannibal Lector
Tell the visual projector, when I'm watching a flick
I reckon need to had your chick, 'cause I got paper to get
Hundred miles per hour, slowing down my viders
Stampede the stateline, flood the booth with powder
I'm balling nigga, three hundred-sixty degrees
In the streets shedding cheese, you better recognize g's
Hollow T-I-P's, choppers and barettas
Fucking with my cheddar, I wet up niggas sweaters
Young in the game, crunching on niggas like ab work
And I'ma chase my paper stacks, till my calves hurt
Feel that, take it from a real cat
Or be a fool run up, and get your wig peeled back

Pay attention cause you listening, to one of the rawest
Cold as a meat locker, which as being I'm flawless
Attitude hoggest, mentality doggest
I pimp my bone, once from August to August
I'm an animal, in the booth I'm a cannibal
With a appetite like Hannibal, bitch I'm flammable
I'm bout to lock it up, beneath the key

Get ready for three minutes, of constant head rushing
Crushing mice, it's a verbal head busting
I'm a mic ripper, plus a motherfucking bike flipper

69,"I've waited long enough and I've been putting it all off
It's time I got myself going again
I've made enough excuses to last 'til the end of time
I've got to move forward with my plans
I tell myself that I am not cut out for this
I don't like anything that's happening now
But when I think of losing everything I've done so far
I know I've got to make it work somehow
What good is a friend if you can't look him in the eye?
What good is honesty if it feels like a lie?
What good is a dream if you never even try?
I thought that I was free and that I left that guy behind
I wanted to believe that someday I'd reach the sky
And if I don't press on then I'll watch the new me die
And the sadder self survive
This isn't as easy as they make it look on TV
I'd never have guessed it was so hard
And maybe you can hear it in the strain of my voice
The perils of it caught me off guard
But when you know that burning deep inside of you
Is not something so easily ignored
You get back on that horse no matter how many times you fall
'Cause it's better than everything you've done before
My life is chronicled in lapses of writer's block
Opening a window to let my feelings be mocked
You ask me why I put myself through this, to you I say
If you've ever chased a dream you know I can have it no other way
This is me today

Perfect little day
Everyone is smiling
A little trip away
You must believe it's so sweet to meet you
Form a little line
Every face is sober

And what does it cost you
Over, and over again

To live from the sweetest revenge
Sickly sugar pink
Everyone is dried up
It's warmer than you think
A cooler place is left off the highway
And maybe if you've planned
All the things you'll do when the bill's paid
Before you pay The Man

Tim took you from ghetto to class, how to hold your glass
To Fendi's to bags, for holdin' your cash
People was seein' you pass, like right through the drapes
I brought you the private, ounce wit the gates
Thinkin' that stuff make me faint, just whistle real fast
Cougars roll in the grass, same cat on your Jag
Why your keepin' them tabs, and callin' me for
It cost every minute, and you know I'm on tour
And I'm deeply committed, although I'm forgettin'
Sometimes while hittin' it, different names would slip
If I been wit a chick, check me miss
Your complexion switched, honey you been on trips
But you don't appreciate this, till your back in the Jetta
No iceberg you own, just Angelica's sweaters
If the steaks ain't T-Bone, you ain't properly fed
Hun tonight is bet burgers, no cheese on the bread

I cleaned up your spot, poured your brandy and scotch
Razor blades to the rocks, even lied to the cops

All dressed in black
That most of them
Not coming back

Sent off to the war
To play little games
And on their return
Can't name no names

Some strange yellow gas
Has played with their minds
Has reddened their eyes
Removed all the lies

And strange as it sounds
Death knows no bounds
How many get well
Only time will tell
Only time will tell

You lie in your death bed now
But what did you bring to the table
Brought us only holy sin
Utter trust is a deadly thing

To the prayer of holy peace
We didn't know what was lying underneath
So how could we be such fools
And to think that we thought you the answer

I can't begin to understand in all the lies
But on your death bed I can see it in your eyes
Just as clear as all the sweat upon your brow
It really makes sense I can see it clearly now

Tangled up in a web of lies
Could have been a way to prophesize
Unaware of the consequence
Not aware of the secrets that you kept

Nothing that we could believe
To reveal the fa&#231;ade of faceless men

But all along your cover plan was to deceive
Can it put to rights now, only time will tell
Your prophecies will send us all to hell as well

Left to all our golden sons
All to pick up on the peace
You could have given all of them
A little chance at least

Take the world to a better place
Given them all just a little hope
Just think what a legacy
You now will leave

We seem destined to live in fear
And some that would say Armageddon is near
But where there's a life, well there's hope
That man won't self destruct

Why can't we treat our fellow man
With more respect and a shake of their hands
But anger and loathing is rife
The death on all sides is becoming a way of life

We live in an uncertain world
Fear, understanding and ignorance is leading to death
Only the corpses are left
For vultures that prey on their bones

But some are just not wanting peace
Their whole life is death and misery
The only thing that they know
Fight fire with fire, life is cheap

But if they do stop to think
That man is teetering right on the brink
But do you think that they care
They benefit from death and pain and despair

85,"Four o'clock in the morning and still we cannot sleep
Turning over, turning 'round, twisting in our sweat
They say there is no rest for the wicked ones
Dear God, what have we done?
There is no rest for the wicked ones
Dear God, what is this evil that we've done?

Is it that we wanted more than you gave?
Why did you put us then in this smalltown grave?
Humility - is that what you want?
Why did you make us then the way you did?
Yes we have pride - is this our sin?
Is it the times that we've been out fighting?
Well I'll tell you all those times - we never really hurt anybody
Or is it that we were eating
While other people were starving?
Is this our crime?

Four o'clock in the morning and still we cannot sleep...

Is it the times we laughed about it all
Through all those whisky nights so far away?

Best kept secret

We all evolved from the city of Gods, we all evolved from the city of Gods
We all evolved from the city of Gods, staf Allah, just give me the nod
Get dough, get low, live life, get nice, rock ice, buy cars, buy bikes
Take trips, live rich, eat good, get dipped, stay hood, stack chips, that's it

Sex cars clothes money and murder, from soldier to server
Hood hoppin, hopin the merger rockin'
My own pops got me open on bonus, no option
Had a heart problem, copin with murmurs the doctrine
No Cochran, winnin' since niggaz was woppin
Way when Rakim was knockin'
Streets was what it was when, thugs was thugs and
Gun wars galore goin' slug for slug and
Jewels drugs and all, niggaz love is love
With the crew wall to wall, I'll be bugged above
So beef war, this way too deep to sleep
Niggaz keep up, cause certified killers creep
Stole this lady I, drove her crazy
You ask me why cause her man tried to play me
So V low quickly and, you better hit me while
I'm lettin this pretty chick get with me
Steppin with double-oh-seven better make it snappy
No time to do your hair baby, brothers is bustin' at me
Blunts and bottles passed, but none on target
They want the God hit, but watch how lah get
Low as Saddam and his pawns so unharmed I'm unarmed
Though I'm calm I could yawn sing a song
I'm the don king of dons King Kong could bring it on
Word is bond

Of course to the kid that cut dope and, never got nauseous
Cooked coke on the comeback, never took losses
With one rap got rich off a ""Life's a Bitch"" chorus
That Jigga shit, nine-six, sittin' with bosses
""Dead Presidents"" see, represents we are
All as one, the call has come to Gods
""Street's Disciple"" discrete, but it be's just like you
Never off beat, stay in heat (?)
Spiteful, no religion, no facelifts no small incisions
No cases pendin though I got dawgs in prison
Reckless livin' though, rest is like the Mets in them extra innings
Hope niggaz respect my dealings if not
Hope not then I, catch no feelings
When you start hearin niggaz left, stressed in buildings
Cold killings old villains now surface seein
In yo' vicinities enemies circlin to sin
Praise I, unfold the untold like +De La+
No +Soul+ since 12 summers old stayed high
Weed conniseur, then rocked designer du'jours
Arman-ah, my persona was raw
No flaws it's federal fucker the cells is tapped
No calls from a double due been to hell and back
So know yours 'cause I could never just, sell you raps
This is my life laid on wax

91,"(Feat. George Clinton)

(Sample)
In the beginning, God created the Heaven and the Earth

(Killah Priest (George Clinton))
(Never met a force) I am the one
(Never met a force)
(Metaphysically in the state of euphoria)
Behold, I am the one
(You are the one)

(Killah Priest)
Within dark heavens, hands open up books
Billion eyes stare before 'em as the audience look
Cosmic lights, it's gothic in the midst of the night
A state of nothingness, a shear bliss descended from heights
From gases, I'm drifting to a liquid to ice
Becoming frozen, the one who was chosen for life
It was I, just a spirit transended from Ja
The 7 heavens, the sixth plain, they switching my brain
I'm like ""Damn, I'm being transformed to man from angel""
I thought it'd be painful, then he reached down his hands
Forming the sands, ""Let us make man and stand until the land
Let's make him dynamic after our likeness
Making him psychic, seeing it was right with our conscience
In our own image, but let's give him limits
Thus his needs for seeds and his womens
And I will plant his emblem to bring him back in remembrance
In time to come, for he was told 'I am the one, I am the one'""

(Chorus: Killah Priest (George Clinton))
(You are..)
(Never met a force lead to metaphys
Metaphysically in a state of euphoria, euphoria)
(Never met a force lead to metaphys, in a state of euphoria, metaphysically)
I am the one
(We were tight back then)
(Grew tight as a love)
(But like the fortune teller, she was right, here we are, so tight)
(So tight)
I am the one, behold

(Killah Priest)
So there I was, flesh and blood, black mud on my face
Naked I came from a celestial plain descended from space
In a distance, my existence was fallen from grace
And in an instant, became an infant, I will fall in this place
Called Earth, made of plant, rock, water, and dirt
And a name that I forgot, was called Walter at first
They cut my umbilical cord, a toddler
I learned how to scribble on floors, I got older
And learned how to dribble a ball
Until the controller opened up my spiritual door
My brain novas and out my mouth, the lyrics will pour
I was born with a seven on my chest, y'all decipher the rest
It's just begun, because y'all will know soon
I am the one, behold, I am the one

(Chorus: Killah Priest (George Clinton))
(Tight as the snug of your embrace)
(We still got the love that fills this place)
(I've held in your arms, but never squeezed too tight)
(Never met a force metaphys
Metaphysically in a state of euphoria, euphoria)
I am the one
(Never met a force lead to metaphys, in a state of euphoria, metaphysically)
(Be yourself if you want the best, be yourself)
(Ask them what we did and when we did it, they'll say 'fuck 'em up')
(Grew tight as a love)
(But like the fortune teller, she was right, here we are, so tight)
(So tight)
Behold, I am the one
(Grew tight as a love)
(But like the fortune teller, she was right, here we are, so tight)
(So tight)
(How late do you have to be before you're absent?)
(In your indos and in your outdos)
(This is, is all a war, as it is, so shall it be)
(If being is what it's about, I is)
(If being is what it's about, I is)
(What goes up, has to come down)

Bring me back again,
I'd really rather not be out here on my own.
Someone reel me in,
I'm drifting ever farther from my home.

I remember when I was a baby
Gazing in amazement at the sky.
Sing it twinkle twinkle little baby
Daddy's gonna learn you to fly...

High...

Like a coment through the sky.

Bring me back again,
I'd really rather not be out here on my own.
I'm drifting with the wind,
Trying to hold the course that I've been shown.

I remember when I was a baby
Staring in amazement at the sun.
Better shield your eyes now little baby
No one ever said you were the one;
No one ever said you were the one
Who can't be blinded by the sun.
I think I'm blinded by the sun.

Part II - Sanity is Coming to Town

I like to taunt, I like to tease.
I'll bring your psyche to its knees.
Juggling.
Sanity is coming to your town.

Who gives a damn what you say,
You're pissing all your dreams away.
Juggling.

Can you breathe?
You used to know everything.

Fake, fake the words I wrote down.
Break, break the boy you couldn't see because he's not searching for your sympathy.
The way your voice sounds... Promises made to me.
So take these words and drink alone tonight.

You haven't called him since September. 
So predictable.
The truth is penathol has finally got the best of you.
You want a gang fight, but while your boozing I hope your cruising.

This is a new revolution, white faced and under attack.
A struggle for revival, the smoke didn't flow to my back.
What is this content, his opinion.
You'll never take me alive, you'll never win.

So hope for a slow death.
Your hand shakes; you know you're next.
Look what you did to yourself
Lies, lies you've all been sold.
Starstruck, you take that road.

Because all your feelings took the best of me.

Can I change your mind?

And you won't let go
While I ignore that we both felt like this before
It starts to show

So, if I have a chance
Would you let me know?

Why aren't you shaking?
Step back in time
Graciously taking
Oh, you're too kind

And if the answer is no
Can I change your mind?

Before it shines

I sometimes feel when we're together baby, everything has turned out wrong 
And I know you feel exactly the same way but still we carry on

It's been a long fight, my heart went right out, oh won't bore you any more
Love wasn't my feeling, my type or my kind

Maybe you'll be yours and I'll be mine

There's always mischief, oh you know the devil's always prying,
Now being good to you is all that's on my mind

Yes your mind gets like a villain, make you splinter
Sing your heart off walking through some long Russian winter
Crying at the sad stories in the paper and on the news
Then I gather up the scattered blessings
To bring them back to you.

And if we make it then we'll be just fine
Be the first I've known in a long, long time.
Told my sad story to anyone who'd listen,
Now I'm in your heart, talking like Ian Dury, I'll be blissin

Praise be the hands that brought this to work now
Turn it on, switch me on
You took my hand, yes that came first
Turn it on, switch it on

I'm full of song, unrehearsed
Go on and turn it up, turn it on, turn it over

Praise be the hands that brought this to work now
Turn it on, switch it on.

Bring it back to you,
Just sing a song it's true
Bring it back to you
Sing a song, it's you, bring it back to you
Lets sing a song that's true

Seek the beast within
Forget all emotions and forget all rules
Let the animal come to life

Where nothing is as you know it today
A desert of death and destruction
Pray that only the suns make day

To reach this land you must travel far
Into space, beyond time
Leave civilisation behind and prepare for
Survival of the fittest / a world of 3 suns

Behold the desert through nocturnal eyes
The endless day / the night pitch black

Eclipsing the suns from the world
Leaving darkness and fear behind
Creatures rule this world
Hunt you down in the dark
Cling to the light and trust the strong to survive
This place is no place for humans
Only creatures get by

They all move too fast
It's the real ones that last
And hold their light until the morning fades

And a coffee cup

I watch the clouds scatter on the hills
And I try to believe
But there's too much time to grieve
For the ones that I loved
And always will

The faucet drips with real despair
Holding on to the words and air
That you will be with me

How can things stay this way
No regrets, I can't forget
It's just not another day)

The promise that you made
It's the time that I forgave

Hollow laughter in marble halls
Steps have been taken, a silent uproar
Has unleashed the dogs of war

I felt a hand tug me then turnin' around I peeped the lovely
Fly face, fat ass gave me a glass of bubbly, said,
""Compliments of Bugsy,"" then took me across the persian rug to plug me
He shook my hand and hugged me; thought he would do me ugly
But he dug me, pockets chubby said, ""Nino where them drugs be?""

Look for my army, fatigues to Giorgio Armani's
Holdin' the Tommy, no one can harm me; Will and Tommy
Tried to alarm me and quote, he turned to smoked salami
Dead as a motherfuckin zombie, full of my ammo
With Bugs Mirando, against the grain so, gotta send him
Over the rainbow, he must be brain slow, caught him down
At the train po' in Santo Domingo, left him for dead
Two bullets in his Tango, like how that movie Shane go
Frank Costello, hostile fellow, he murders while remainin mellow

Cold blooded veins flowin with red Jell-o

To put you in pajamas, fly hooker fine as the Pocahontas
Beauty queen you'll wanta pok-her-hiendas

To veto, so they hit him with a hollow torpedo

Lex Diamond was scheamin on Capone's scroll
Wanted to own his whole zone, it leaked out
They shot him at a pay phone
With the big chrome, his whole wig blown
Blood flowin from out his flesh and bones

Family got hit up with automatics
Non-stop static inside the rackets
Jack McGern was burnin split Joe Adonis cabbage
The underworld was goin' savage
Pretty Boy Floyd was non-void, unemployed, he destroyed shit
With the Infamous click, wasn't to be toyed with
Mad jealous of all the liquor sellers
Shinin with wine cellars, turn 'em from hood dwellers to Goodfellas
Me and Nitty was like bank tellers, nothin' niggaz could tell us
We drove all over, I pushed a shiny yellow Testarossa
Moved on it closer get the toaster
Started to feel like death was closer, I hit Capone hard
Murder him and his bodyguard in they car and dust the chaffeur
Beef over, I blew him like a supernova

The Lady Casanova, yo I'm even deadly when I'm sober

And blast the two right through your boulder

M-Balmer, holdin' down the morgue
Pull yo' body out the drawer
Got these fools from the Eastside, the fluid's what they came here for
Put the rest in my lab coat and serve them fools a part
Now I'ma keep rock to chop, stirrin up to the pulpit
And deliver it, I spit sparks like gunfire straight to they head
What's the purpose of the strap if he's already dead?
Stretched out, because of somethin' that nobody said
Warning, gee williker cause that Tec-9 be killin' ya
Hit the main artery, he's lookin' real saucy
Chrome to yo' dome and lookin' like Top Ramen

You thought you motherfuckers was gonna get away
You thought she wouldn't be able to embalm you
She's actually gonna, put, your head, up, your ass

Hey yo, I usually ain't into chasin' the mommy's
Get it then I hit it like Jason Giambi
Until I met Wendy up in Envy
She had a coupe and a Bentley, the inside Fendi
Hey yo, she friendly, far from your average groupie
The hoochie ate sushi and kept her coochie in Gucci
I knew she was checkin' me out
Then locked in her sight, she never lettin' me out
We parkin' lot pimpin', frontin' on a celly
Mesmerized by the tattoo on her belly
I came with Sean P, she came with Tawana
You shoulda seen those ho's ass in these Dolce Gabbana's
And there's somethin' about her, made me shake the ho's off
And I ain't touch her, but I could tell she was so soft
And I seen baller's tryin' to floss to show off
Now I'm like Biz Mark', about to 'Go Off'
They hit the dance floor, dancin' to Chingy
Dressed up kinky, movin' all freaky
Hey yo, I like the way she shake it 'Right Thurr'
Dancin' in the mirror, playin' with her hair
She tried to act like she didn't notice me stare, man
I walked up to her like I ain't care
Made eye contact, I knew I had a chance
When we danced, the hooker put her hands in my pants

Our reason for fighting is this...
We were only meant to fight in one war only
That battle between the sons of light...
And the sons of darkness, ordained by God
That is our service
Now we see that this is that battle and we will fight...
Under your command

(Killah Priest *humming the beat during sample*)
Priesthood...

I stepped in a church ashamed, naked and hurt
Wet from the rain, my face shows pain
I'm desperate in search for answers
Grabbed the panther that the ushers handed
Blood stain shown through my shirt 'cause beneath, my arm was bandaged
I walked up the aisle but didn't stop till I got the altar
I was being blocked by the preacher's supporters
But he'd seen my torture
So-called friends filled me with false love
I spoke ""Sorry I have nothing to offer but lost hope and an empty soul""
See the Devil tempts me like Jobe, everything I had I now owe
He took my girl, shook my world, lost my crib
It was all his except for my kids
That's what I thought till I'm at court with my wiz
She doubled-crossed me then slid
She forced me to live in solitude now the bottle's my food
I follow no rules but if the gospel is true
Then I'm his apostle like you
But he stopped me cold and called me a fool
He said I was rude the way I'd intrude
Then I tossed him this jewel...

(Chorus: Killah Priest w/ ad-libs)
The greatest thing I've ever known...
Greatest thing I've ever known...
The greatest lesson ever learned...
The greatest lesson ever learned...
Most precious thing I've ever owned...
Most precious thing I've ever owned...
Though it left it shall return...

All I know is what I've known...

You judge me but what would you do if you was me?
If you saw through my eyes, if you've felt the pain that I've felt inside
What would you do? Would you cry?
Ah, thought so, I do sometimes...
See you have a home and a swimming pool, the big backyard (yeah?)
Large living room, fed with a silver spoon
You probably sinning too but don't know
Pardon me if I'm offending you but I won't go
I question my faith, been in a depressional state (yeah man)
Self-hate, one day blessings will wait
Stared death in his fate, planning my 'scape
I've seen D's stretching out tape
I've 'visioned prison dates, injected with the venom of snakes
Women with grapes, slept with in rooms pyramid-shaped
Walls covered with hieroglyphics, I'm far from religious
It was said in my first introduction
Which was Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth
For me it went deeper than just reading a verse
Seeing it first, I needed work

We ain't gotta lie
You might as well just pack our bags and just say goodbye

I think we should call it quits 'cause we can't go on like this.

Struggles... in the ghetto, going through hell to come out right
This is what we must go through to reach heaven
That's what we go through
This what we go through to reach heaven to escape hell

(Chorus 4X: Hell Razah)
In the Days of Our Lives we got One Life to Live
As the World Turns around negative through positive
At the edge of the nights, The Guiding Light
That leads to Another World
For the Young and the Restless beware of your Deathwish
To All My Children in the General Hospital
The most impossible
We got for you the final saga of the Street Operas

(Killah Priest)
In my location is where they run the operation
You either stuck or getting bucked by the train station
Word is bond if beyond after dawn, they hit you up bad
And watch drop and they gone, they 9mm's
Make bitches scream high-pitch like a tweater
But shorty is a strong believer when he hold his heater
I use an ounce of my mind to make rhymes
And a half of my brain to cause rain
'Cause life is like a game with no instructions
Streets they be tusslin' to have a brother bustin'
They adolescence carry weapons in they section, a wrong direction
When they all pack protection, forgotten knowledge, is all symbolic
And heathenistic, they need statistics, for cops to search
Yhey pop you first and dig your pockets later
And maybe catch you for money and your pager (gimme that)
Or slice your throat with the razor.
An old man told me once, sitting on a chair rolling a blunt
""I had a son your age, that ended up on front page
From the impact of a 12 Gauge, his assassination
Drove me in a world of hatred, today it's hard to face it""
He showed me old flicks, he was up for a scholarship
But it ended by a hollow tip
Damn I never thought life could be so short
I still see him on the basketball court
Fought in my life, I shedded great tears
Tryin' to escape here, but for me it might take years
Walk towards these fears and I'm still here.
He rolled back in his wheelchair
And said, ""The streets is vicious
And all the witches play you for your riches
They blow you kisses and show you stitches""
So then he pulled back his pictures

(Chorus - replace ""beware of your Deathwish"" with ""expect the unexpected"")

The final saga of the street operas, of the street operas
The final saga of the street operas

You feel the cold inside of yourself
People scrambling desperately to get out of your way

Then you see her, exhilaration breaking your icy calm
A raging fire, driving you on with incredible speed
But the music is still there, and the distance doesn't decrease
There is a flight of stairs, an endless corridor
Pressing through a window, running in the rain
Feeling a sudden burn in your flesh
She is still there, in front of you
You can see her, but the music sticks to your mind

You're skidding through the rain, getting desperate
Darting through another back entrance
Dashing through a corridor
Spilling out into a room full of people, and music
The music. It's burning in your mind, driving you mad
There is only the music. The music
There is nothing else. Nothing else
Only the floor rushing toward you

Inside your bloodstream I would drown
I've swallowed all my pride,
How quickly down my throat it slides
Across that bed of nails I'd crawl,
For just another swallow

But now -
How does it feel, how does it feel anyway?
Doesn't feel that different today...
On the outside looking in,
Legs wrapped tight around a grin
Looking into the heart of the hollowness...
Looking in... It's on the tip... On the tip of my tongue

Doing donuts in the parking lot

Driving fast moving cars,

Thinking I could paint all those stars,

Empty bottles on an empty stage
And a story on the final page
Of a book that no one knows about
This is it this is my last goodbye
This is where my dreams go to die
In the trash behind the record shop

I'm driving fast moving cars,
And drinking old in these bars
And Thinking I could paint all those stars
Singing old timed songs
And thinking I could right all these wrongs
And drinking till the pain is all gone

With a few tricks hidden up my sleeve

Gets just a little leaner

We've turned it off in the night 

Between the banks that roll

To hold us up

Well worth the holding

I brought that genuine shit in '96
Before you knew the underground or independent existed
I watched the whole scene straight jump on the dick
After stepping to KCR lit and flexing my shit
No gun talk, no gimmicks, just rounds of raw-dogging
Dirty dusty intelligent wit and word murdering
A hardcore poetic informed without burglary
Potent and shook the shit out of rappers who just learned of me
Everytime I prescribe a new pill, revolution
Quickly defined the standard for indie rap distribution
Arrogant unafraid shit developed riding a train thinking of brain fucks
""Bad Touch Example"" that soon became bucks
Had everybody sprung wondering where I came from
Screaming out ""Independent as fuck"" with an insane tongue
With an indelible squad of design monsters
Innovating the styles that made biters look like imposters
So we scripted an album and signed to Rawkus
Selling a hundred thousand without a radio chart hit
Imposterous sonics taking the world hostage
Classic hip-hop bombage dirty with style progress
Now I've come from the '80s juvenile Brooklyn
Where cats was like: ""Gimme that subway pass, kid. Good lookin'.""
Now someone else is taking a ride with what's mine
So I had to develop styles with a death device cooked in
So when I battled in basements I had eight sentences
Waiting way before the four you had laced in
And I was taught to wait patient (Why?)
Only faggots make shit up just to get famous
So when I finally blew up I remained sick
Earning respect in ghettos and 'burbs for word placement
Back when the independent scene remained faceless
We were the only crew who promised your ass we'd take it
Mold it, shape it, living outside the matrix
Hold it, make it, more than miniature major labels
Hold it sacred, living it for the culture
Told ya plainly, protected it from the vultures
That's why I always get respect from true soldiers
While half of the critics claim it every year: ""Hip hop's over.""
FUCK YOU, hip hop just started
It's funny how the most nostalgic cats are the ones who were never part of it
But true veterans'll give dap to those who started it
Then humbly move the fuck on and come with that new retarded shit
New slang, new thought, new sound
Who's heart you thought you had?
You clown, you don't, you drown
I won't dumb it down, I'm dumbing now for these rounds
I'm a live mothefucker plus I'm gunning for clowns
You're mine motherfucker, don't be coming for pounds
So you can break out of that invisible box, you're not down
My favorite ones are the ones who started that young rap about
Comic books, spaceships, and Obi-Quan one
And even though they were soft they had fun
But they couldn't break out the frame of the town they came from
Some of these faggots used to send me their demos
I'm keeping their puppy styles in the Company Flow kennels
But since they had no identity from the start
They started to resent the scene when they couldn't become a part
They've been failing for years and call themselves Vets, that's bold
Motherfucker, you're not a Vet you're just old
I'll slap the shit out of you to continue my nerve racket
Making this money fist over fist, fuck what you heard
Jukie cats talk about boom bap and golden ages
Patting themselves on the back for making that new outdated shit
I've been putting out vinyl since '93 and never looked back once
And y'all trying to chase me
You don't innovate because you can't innovate
It's not a choice despite what you might tell your boys
Keep your identity crisis under the table
I always knew who I was and I'll always be more famous

'Cause it's so obvious that it's never gonna work for us
No no oh no (No)

Played with my emotions (Played)
You gets no devotion (And you gets no love, gets no love)
You can't get no love from me
You can't even be my friend (Be my friend)
And you gets no love again
Whatever you do it will come back to you bitch
(You gets no love from me)

(Verse 2: Faith Evans)
Tell you why we can't hook up (You gets no love)
'Cause I had about enough (You gets no love)
Hearin all the lies you tell (You gets no love)
Boy I thought I knew you well
People think that you're my man (People think that you're my man)
They don't even understand (They don't even understand)
Just because I let you get some that don't make you the one
We ain't even in love (You know you played with my...)

(Chorus: Faith Evans)
Played with my emotions You gets no devotion
You gets no love, you can get no love from me
You can't even be my friend (Can't be my friend)
And you gets no love again
Whatever you do it will come back to you bitch

(Bridge: Faith Evans (P. Diddy))
([P.Diddy:] Yo! Faith let 'em know!)
You better, rock my shit don't knock my shit
Because I got the shit that make you cop my shit
I know y'all sick of this Bad Boy diva
That blows and plus got flows ridiculous
You better, rock my shit don't knock my shit
Because I got the shit that make you cop my shit
It's the chick from the bricks that got the hot shit
Left you sick from the single now check the remix
Boy you had a clue, thought we had a cool relationship
But you couldn't handle it (You couldn't handle it)

(Verse 3: G. Dep (P.Diddy))
Yo! At the end of the day what a playa 'gon do? (Badboy)
You got love for me, It's how supposed to be
Same love I'm a land on you (Come on)
Right back at you it's only natural
So what I'm gon' do? Me
Everything love ain't always lovely
Leave it all up to me, I'll be livin' in luxury, sucker free
Without no lies without no ties to those that patronize
That's why I don't socialize
I eat, shit, even sleep with open eyes
Just, give me that gasoline
I'll move in the jag few bags of green
Couple ads in the magazine
All freezy and I'm easy G Deezy one

Played with my emotions, you gets no devotion
Whatever you do it will come back to you bitch
You can't even be my friend, cause you gets no love again
Can't even be my friend, and you gets no love again

You played with my emotions and you gets no devotion
Can't even be my friend, and you gets no love again
You played with my emotions and you gets no devotion
Can't even be my friend, and you gets no love again

(Chorus: Faith Evans)
Played with my emotions You gets no devotion
You gets no love, you can get no love from me
You can't even be my friend (Can't be my friend)
And you gets no love again
Whatever you do it will come back to you bitch

So what do we do if I can't hold this pose for too long?
Do we shoot again, or does the whole operation shut down
And we go back to the board?
I practiced all my lines, oh yeah
I'd feed every child in the world
But it's a one night stand baby
We gotta keep on

If you got it all then you got it right

I'm gonna do what you say and get way out of line
Nobody's gonna stop me now
It's not how it looks unless you saw nothing
We all agree this proposal's been sentenced to death

Are we baiting the right hook to catch your attention?
The media needs another blackout
We've been calling
Flooding hotlines

We've applied mascara to the radio
But that's just a quick fix and we need a little more
Does it matter to you at all?
Are you listening or have you tuned out?

We've gotta get it together
But first we drink and we take it all apart
'Cause everywhere we go we're the local boys and we're back in town
Well that's the way it is
And it breaks my heart

We've applied mascara to the radio,

Good and evil like two sides
Of a coin made of madness
Sometimes dark sometimes bright
Innocence and guilt only shapes
Of a game I cannot win
Lust and despise only pattern
No one to blame
My mind as gloom as a cave
As dark as a grave

Strength and weakness only schemes
Not to care, killed myself
Long time ago
No one for the guilt to share
The end of the game now it is quite near
I confess the guilt I'm afraid I cannot bear

As dark as a grave

To escape my fate
How many slaugther will there pave

And the colors so fine,
That's enough

Where no sun's shining through
Walk away... leave me here there's
Nothing you can do to set me free

Still speaks in angels's tongues

With all the rights, and all the wrongs

So please, please go

Where no sun's shining through
Walk away... leave me here there's

Nobody home, nobody home
No need to cry, maybe to die
Down here alone...

Where no sun's shining through
Walk away... leave me here there's
Nothing you can do to set me free

And the light always warms my bones
But the light brings the dark in shadow
And somewhere inside I know.

The midwinter snow so white
In its celestial path in the sky

I refuse to fail, to kneel or bow.
No power in the 'verse can stop me now.
Leading me towards the dawn of day.
The stars above illuminate my way.

My burden an awful load
My chest holds a heart of gold
In the stories a child is told
A legend amongst the old.

It speaks of a legacy
One of me and my family.
And I burn for their right to survive
To be alive.

And the words they say which we won't understand

Or you'll find that you're joining in

It's a sin that somehow
Light is changing to shadow
And casting its shroud over all we have known
Unaware how the ranks have grown
Driven on by a heart of stone
We could find that we're all alone
In the dream of the proud

On the wings of the night
As the daytime is stirring
Where the speechless unite in a silent accord
Using words you will find are strange
Mesmerised as they light the flame
Feel the new wind of change
On the wings of the night

No more turning away
From the weak and the weary
No more turning away from the coldness inside
Just a world that we all must share
It's not enough just to stand and stare
Is it only a dream that there'll be
No more turning away?

It's all so sad

See her falling down

She won't last

216,"So I'm still plodding on,
On a path I cannot see.
So I left it all behind,
For a future where I'm free.

All my dreams had turned to dust,
And my lust for life declined.
All my hopes had gone away,
Just a trace left in my mind.

For my will stopped to resist,
I let it take me away.
For my whole world fell apart,
What is left I cannot say.

And everything I was has turned to pain,
And everyone I knew thinks I'm to blame.
And everything I was has turned to pain,
And everyone I knew thinks I'm to blame.
And everywhere I go I feel the same,
And every time I try I try in vain.

You had come to fill the void,
But you always were forlorn.
You had come into my life,
And you brought both sun and storm.

I could never break its force,
And then I was left to mourn.
I never knew what went wrong,
But you were both sun and storm.

When you came I did not fear,
But the shadow took your side.
When you fell I had to stay,
But I think I've also died.

And everywhere I go I feel the same,
And every time I try I try in vain.
And everything I was has turned to pain,
And everyone I knew thinks I'm to blame.
And everywhere I go I feel the same,
And every time I try I try in vain.

Searching for a perfect day (a perfect day)
It never happens that way, a hey, hey, hey

You never heard a word I said (a word I said)
It seems simple to me
That if you knew you wouldn't say (you wouldn't say)
It never happens that way, a hey, hey, hey

And the impression I get as the story unfurls
Is that you're the hardest thing in the world

Plus a cooked slab, chopped up, dimes is swoll
If I spot the laws comin', hey its time to roll
Candy Carter got a line of parole, Outta control
The first fell a Tuesday this month oh sweet thang
Plus it's a sweet day, me next score for three days

With a note behind demandin three chickens or she gets it
Do not twist because lil man is trippin'

I promise ya never fuckin' sleep, I clear the set
Come outside late at night to your surprise I'm here with Tecks
Two shots knock off the niggas necks, it's so realistic
So I hope ya get it, or else them shots poke ya fetti
Be on the block until them souljas hit it

If you don't want no problems
You better get off the corner

I make a livin' in this crooked public distributin
Just take a peek around, the hood is floodin, shit is boomin
The hottest D in town lookin' for me hit me Tuesday, like after six
See I crack the bricks right down to Z's
Got pounds of trees, my blocks blazin' qp's to ki's
Gangin' in the cheese, them bricks is comin'
No droughts I don't sit on nothin'
I don't believe I'm frontin
If I give you a dime, I leave with somethin'
The big dog, Nigga I got the city under siege
And the law don't bother me, I give the pigs a couple of G's
Shit, I hustle strong to push this work through the streets
I'm tryin' to deal with every nigga, and sell the birds up cheap
I'm greedy, if there's any money bein made from drugs I need it
Twenty bricks two weeks completed, you can't beat it
Whatever you want, holla at me when you need to get it
Does anybody else, I'll pay 'em a visit
That's when ya heard...

Come here peeps
I'm hearin that you run these streets
You don't want beef
Then get off the corner

Over rivers, farms, and state lines
The distance from me to where you'd be
It's only finger-lengths that I see

I touch the place
Where I'd find your face
My fingers in creases
Of distant dark places

I hang my coat up in the first bar
There is no peace that I've found so far
The laughter penetrates my silence
As drunken men find flaws in science

Their words, mostly noises
Ghosts with just voices
Your words in my memory
Are like music to me

I'm miles from where you are
I lay down on the cold ground, and I
I pray that something picks me up
And sets me down in your warm arms

After I have travelled so far
We'd set the fire to the third bar
We'd share each other like an island
Until exhausted, close our eyelids

And dreaming, pick up from
The last place we left off
Your soft skin is weeping
A joy you can't keep in

I lay down on the cold ground, and I

And sets me down in your warm arms

It's like I die once that I be born again
With the grace of Allah
Kept away my sins
From the ghetto where they play with heavy metal to win
Lost my parents so I moved with my next-of-kin

This emptiness burns inside
And leads on for endless miles

Don't let me go
Away across the sea,

Than what it seems to be

The way back to be freed
The loneliness hangs around us
However we can't see

Now let me go
Away across the sea,
The waves can't be as high
As they pretend to be

In my heart, I won't forget
The sails against the blue sky
That taught me how to live

And tomorrow we'll share
Silence and distance
Till our faults are repaired

Quit mother goosin' this ain't no story
I'm a cutthoat pimp fighting for my glory
It's me, MD, bitch follow me
And we can get paid like dick swallowing
Bada bing bada bang, it really ain't no thang
I'm deep in this game, and you a freakyness dame
So we can exchange the pimpin' for the hoe-in
Baby you ain't knowin' the top is where I'm goin'
There's no one that could ever do it better
I gets my cheddar, mozzarella or whatever...
Or whatever, the earth is my turf
Where I roam is my home, cutthoat rolling stone
Catch me with ladies in a fuckin' Mercedes
Countin' fetti while I'm sucking on tetties
I dress eighties, keep it old schoolish
So shut the fuck up nigga and let me do this
Who this? Oh it's you
You got ??? for me baby bring it with that other two
I'm blinging and because of you, I live Lav'
Everything I want is everything I have
It's the lifestyle of the sav' and lavish
Girl money makes the world twirl, I'm having cabbage
Kick back relax let me bust one mo'
I'm a gun slinger partner I do a gung ho
Got a dumb flow, keep more than one ho
It's Mr. Hicks in the mix nigga hear me in the gumbo
Run ho, your squares a box
And I'm a thug, the kind of guy that will swear to your pops
I fled from the cops, and sold rocks in my past time
And jack fools straight faced with no mask I'm
A cutthoat, I don't have to prove it to ya
I'll leave ya ass up with buckshots movin' through ya
I'ma do ya like you never been done
Have you screaming ""I need bullets hurry up run""

Till every friend I'd known was gone

Everything was strange

Everything was strange

When in rags and when in wealth
A solemn promise never to give too much of myself
Despite the hopeful words I've said
I've lived my life inside my head

Then one day, I was not alone
Everything had changed
Everything was strange

Everything was strange

I hold my breath and count to ten
I hate it now, hated it then
Seen it all before
A failure and a bore
That's what friends are for

So it seems I must have won
As I survey the ashes of the damage that I've done
Everyone I've ever known
Is just as closed off and alone

Then one day, I was not alone

Get laid and played out of pocket with a rocket in your eye socket
So raise up queers, and say your fuckin' prayers

And crazy man Michael will curs&#232;d be""

And beat at the four winds with his fists-O
He laughed and he cried, he shouted and he swore
For his mad mind had trapped him with a kiss-O
""You speak with an evil, you speak with a hate
You speak for the devil that haunts me
For is she not the fairest in all the broad land?
Your sorcerer's words are to taunt me""

The bird fluttered long and the sky it did spin
And the cold earth did wonder and start-O
""O where is the raven that I struck down dead
That here did lie on the ground-O?
I see but my true love with a wound so red
Where her lover's heart it did pound-O""

Crazy Man Michael he wanders and walks
And talks to the night and the day-O
But his eyes they are sane and his speech it is plain
And he longs to be far away-O

And asks of the wild wolves their pardon
For his true love is flown into every flower grown

In the place between summer and winter,
She's the last ray of light in the cold dark of night,
She's sudden and secret,

I know you hear me whenever you're near me.

She's the first to be heard and the last dying word,
As the tear stains collect on your pillow,
She's the shape in the rain through a cold windowpane,
She suddenly sees you,

I know you hear me whenever you're near me.

Walk with me in Hell

Pray for resolve
Pray for a savior
Pray for deliverance, some kind of purpose

Hope dies in hands of believers
Who seek the truth in the liar's eye

Queens is the home of 1, the known felon
And ain't no tellin', when I'ma crack your fuckin' melon
For the right amount of chips, I spit clips and hit whips
Leavin' niggaz bloody, the leather seats is where the shit drips

When I cock back the iron, niggaz is dyin', marchin to Zion

When I was younger always carried guns, I never had toys

On niggaz foreheads to makin' motherfuckers Indian
You got beef? Go get yourself a wreath, because it's murder
'Cause I put holes in my beef like fuckin' White Castle burgers
So now I gots to run up on a clown with the fo'-pound
Cock back, rock black, gun a nigga down
I see em, he's comin' out the fuckin' coliseum
And hopped into a BM, shit!
Put in my clip and then I dipped into the ride that my man had
Parked on the sidewalk, then we start to glide
I'm rainin on him (faster nigga) oh yeah we're gainin on him
(Oh shit he's with somebody else) fukkit, put his brain on him
Boom boom, no survivors, lifted the nigga out his seat
When they find him, he'll be a backseat driver
But I ain't finished with the trigger yet, I'm lightin up a cigarette
Bang bang, I left the other nigga wet

Burn as brightly as we can
And if it's got to end then let it end in flames
Let it burn all the way down

Turning in its simple steps on slow currents
And I watch as it pirouettes and spins in slow motion
A long drag becomes a slow dance in a halo of ember

If it is born in flames then we should let it burn
Burn as brightly as we can
And if it's got to end then let it end in flames
Let it burn all the way down

Motherfucker

(Indistinguishable singing)

(MURS)
Now this here's for your spouse or significant other
You were in love with the person, now you hate the motherfucker
Get the fuck out! Tell 'em to get the fuck out!
You weren't lookin' for love when you met 'em at the club
Y'all exchanged numbers and went out for some grub
You waited three days then decided to call
Went for dinner and a movie, then a walk through the mall
All you saw was the physical, a sexy individual
Never had the thought that they would make your life miserable
A couple more dates, consummate the mating ritual
Soon you will encounter the habitual liar
The sex was so good it set your body afire
But why are you still with this nut?
Every time they come around you get this feelin' in your gut
Wanna tell 'em, ""Raise up,"" but your mouth stays shut
When you stop to think about how good they fuck
An' when the sex gets old you'll wind up stuck
So here's some words of wisdom that'll help you with the chore
Count up their I.Q. before you kick 'em to the door
It goes:

(Chorus: MURS)
One, two, three, four
I had it up to here and I'm not takin' no more
So get the fuck out! You gots to get the fuck out!
Everybody come on! One, two, three, four
I had it up to here and I'm not takin' no more
So get the fuck out! You gots to get the fuck out!
Everybody!

(MURS)
Now say you have a homeboy who's been sleepin' on your couch
For weeks on end and he's (words walk 'em out?)
Get the fuck out! Tell him to get the fuck out!
Now he walks around your house in nothin' but his drawers
Throws the trash once a week and expects to get applause
Let him stay at your crib you was down for his cause
He was in between girls, or in between jobs
But it's still no excuse for him to be a slob
Your girl stays mad 'cause she's cleanin' up behind him
You can't get your calls when he's on the other line an'
You can't get laid 'cause he has the worst timin'
Knockin' at your door at odd hours of the night
If he does that shit again, you swear to God you're gonna fight
But you can't kick him out 'cause it's just not right
He has nowhere else to go, but you're losin' self-control
Wanna kill him in his sleep, God bless his soul
Maybe it's not that bad but it could get worse
So here's a little tip from your homeboy MURS
Before you tell him ""Bounce,"" do a countdown first
It goes:

(MURS)
Now let's talk about these old motherfuckers on the mic
Who were dope but now are whack and won't leave the spotlight
Get the fuck out! You gots to get the fuck out!
He had some albums that I loved way back in the day
But as he puts out new shit, the memories begin to fade
When I heard about the comeback I said ""No way!""
I was waitin' on the real, the anticipation built
But with age came degeneration of the skill
So I pushed it to the back of my mind, and hoped in time
Those fine memories would once again shine
But he just won't stop, even though his album flop
Everytime I turn around his new one's about to drop
Make me wanna take all his old records off the shelf
Cause the man I now hear's a shadow of his former self
So when he stopped on tour, in my town for a show
I played a true fan and was in the front row
As he started doin' classics, then he stopped and said ""No""
We had to say we love the new shit, before he did the old
I tried to count the countdown, but then I lost control
It went one, two, three, four
I had it up to here, and I'm not takin' no more
So get the fuck out! You gots to get the fuck out!
Everybody come on!

273,"This morning there are no rods or staffs
To comfort you dressed as a target
As you amble in your chains and stumble through
The corridors that lead to our makeshift valley of death

In the prison's backyard
Where you'll give us your final breath
Last night I saw you dine with lovers and human tears
But glanced at me in ways
That brought to life my sleeping fears
That today you'll bite my neck

Peel away the aging skin
Expose this lifeless body in a boy
Divinity within (I watch my temple fall to pieces)
Divinity within (I watch my temple fall to pieces)

So tell me why
When I've read you your rights,
When the guns are in their place
When your crime no longer seems absurd...

When your crime's no longer absurd,
What will you say when we ask you,
What are your final words?

When your crime's no longer absurd,
What will you, what will you say, Kezia, when we ask:
What are your final words?

Till another day of artificial grace
In my mind I'm chasing bad guys
Through empty streets and dark alleways

I'm a crimestopper, a good copper
I kick the doors in
Bad against good in my neighbourhood
Stand aside and watch it all begin

A police car howls in the distance
The city sleeps but I'm wide awake

Wack MC's are like abortions, 'cause I ain't havin' none of them
So break it down for me I can't understand
Nowadays you got more rappers than you got fuckin' fans
And man listen that's a pity
That shit wouldn't come off the shelves if a earthquake hit the city
If they ain't pullin blunts, they pullin triggers
I'm gettin' tired of DJ Nobody and MC New Nigga
Huh, I start cyphers for self in dark alleys
I wreck shows lovely 'cause I got nine personalities
I kick the real on ear-woundin tracks

The paper raper, yeah flatline massager
Don't worry cause MC's see me blurry like Roger Thomas
Without his glasses - momma, I can't breathe
I'm fat and black, I squeeze the life outta MC's
So please, keep your style in your grab bag
Rappers step up and get sent back like a shag

Watch the skeleton dance
Dance On my grave

Here I am alone
Casting my own shadows
Traversing the mundane
Desperate cry

Boundless darkness
A voiceless fear
Unheard, unseen
It is coming near

Watch the skeleton dance
Dancing on my grave
My frozen hour of death
Watch the skeleton dance
Here I am - alone

Had I not known
That I was dead
I would have mourned

Check your thunderpound, it be Skillz blowing up from the underground
Now, don't waste your time and try to taste mine
I'm killing MC's and going low-key like baselines
Be hesitant, VA residents ain't friendly
Diss and I'll walk on your back like Mr. Benny
When my shit drop, all this wack shit'll stop
Till Janet stops, rockin' Planet Rock
Keepin' it real hot
I specialize in microphone satisfaction
Hackin' MC's who think Skillz be relaxin'
Straight from punchline ave, metaphor metropolis
I'm shockin' MC's like seeing their grandmothers topless
Watch this, check for my sequal
I make raps and niggas vanish like the Village People
Hey, you checkin' for me check &#24966;ound my way
They say Skillz don't play when he's representin' VA

Chorus 4x: [Mad Skillz]
Virginia's in the house [I said it]

Verse two: Mad Skillz

Yo, niggas get pissed, MC's cease to exist
As I persist, to drill mics and fill glock clips
Don't sleep, like Mobb Deep, I'm leaving brothers shook
While you debatin' I'm urinatin' on your rap book

All my peeps down in VA, this one's for you B

Their rhymes used to be worth something like Mr. T's gold
Now I'm in, so watch me Kline like Calvin
I'm the Dread Man, you fucked up by lettin' me make an album (huh)
The outcome is ill, when I grip the steel
Don't be mad at me (why?), if you ain't got no skill
No questions, no second guessin' without a doubt
Niggas know my name and they know who's in the house

Verse three: Mad Skillz

Is VA up in here? (HELL Yeah!)
Then here's a jam for you to spread across the state like welfare
I'm a special dread, that still be tactics
Doing MC's anytime, anyplace like Janet Jackson
It ain't about dirt roads and corn bread
Niggas be MC'ing, G'ing, war deeds and dread
After this pack it up, I'll tell you my plan
I'm on a VA tour with Kalonji my man
Check it, hittin' city to city like a horny trucker
This year, it's East Coast like a motherfucker
Misconceptions are coming back like reflections
Niggas who dissed, are now checkin' for my section
They wanna be down, they makes me laugh

I got more rhymes in the summer than musty underarms

On earth as it is in a dime store. For all the amateurs that you've
Knelt before.
Breaks my mind in two.
They surrounds us.
One more night without you.
They surrounds us.
Take my will with you.
They surrounds us.
Break my mind into...

One, breathe in to be free
Two more time and you'll see
Three, it will numb all the pain
How hard is it to be sane?

Won our will to be seen
Raise our hands and we'll scream
Speak your mind and you'll see
What it is like to free

One breather in to be free
Two more times and you'll see
Three it will numb all the pain
How hard is it to be sane?

Get paid with the stage with the mic control
I'm pro and all official, I'll ball witchu
All my problems off a thizzle, a small little
I'm a boo but cool and calm you know that's me
I tell them Miami thing about to throw that d
And a home philly east until she roll that weed
But she can shoot with the breeze it's nothing to quease
Like a sneeze I'm blessed
So you can excuse me, I'm too busy watching hoes poppin' their coochie
Oh yeah I can see why you call me breezy
My 'ginese connections got deals on QDs

And we still conversatin' so we keep it pimpin'

I need paper, hey, up in a major way
I won't cater a player for those that hatin' the game
I say later don't look at this as doing me a favor
I made a pact with my home boys to keep it player


Yo this is the take off, and yo baby this is the bake off
Sirloin beef with the A1 steak sauce
I got it going on acting like a love jones
Turn like a cyclone, bust with the lights on
I hit the scene like Peppy La pui
I'm in a double vested suit that I copped from Lou
I'm from the X generation, crime location
Turn down your invitation to your radio station
Move like a cobra gone from the rollas
It's just like the hunt for the red October
Some pit-bull terrier from the Ronald Regan era
And me and my players keep it cold as the Sierra
We dress like it's GQ magazine and the homies said he gotta keep a magazine
And this freak said she see me in the magazine
So we broke down jaw on the magazine
My sugar heel and under field with 4 wheels
And driving with my knees so that we don't spill
I'm going at you gator on your izod sweater
And broke cats say there ain't nothing like cheddar
They bomb first and say I'm caught up in the wrong curse
And I never get to kick it with the god flirt
And when I ask why, it was an alibi

As I floss Jaguar, to wherever you are
Long distance in the distance on my cellular
And no way's too far for my private jet
I'm on a flight, hold tight, keep it nice and wet
Please don't get upset, the fun just begun
Wanna want a job done, will you make me a son?
Will you make me a daughter? Do I need to pump harder?
Turn the temperature up on the bed so we can heat 'em warmer
A heart of a villain, a thug-like nigga gets harder gets liver
More deeper to the river
You shiver you shake, ice cream and candy
I wonder how it feel when your water breaks
No mistakes allowed at the rodeo show
And I'm lettin' you ladies know that I love you so, uh

As I gaze in your eyes, it's not a surprise
That I'm the perfect size bumpin' between your thighs
Just time to realize, don't need a disguise
I'm a star on the rise, only out for the price
Dig deep into your soul, then get caught in the rapture
Yo' mind I'ma capture, night before morning after
First chapter Illuminati, beamas and benzes
7-day vacations, all-paid expenses
I'm a playa fo' life, thanks to this rap
I can floss, I can flap, with my salary cap
H-Town's on the map, and nothing is negative
I'm the owner of the firm, I make you an executive
Cause just then you will see that you do wanna be
With Lil' Keke in the land of free
Do you wanna, are you gonna? Let's sit in the sauna
And laugh our life away while we blow marijuana
It's goin' DOWN

Ah... I see the little latest out there acting bad
On that one right there

He didn't have to be rude

You see her with the green dress
She talked to me at the bar
How come it's already two pound fifty?
We've only gone about a yard
Didn't you see she were gorgeous
She were beyond belief
There was this lad at the side drinking a Smirnoff Ice
Came and pay for her tropical reef

And I'm sitting going backwards
And I didn't want to leave
I said it's High Green, mate
Via Hillsborough, please

Well, how funny were that sketch earlier
Up near that taxi rank
Oh, no, you will have missed it
I think it were when you went to the bank
These two lads squaring up proper shouting
About who was next in the queue
The kind of thing that would seem so silly
But not when they've both had a few

Well, calm down, temper, temper
You shouldn't get so annoyed
When you're acting like a silly little boy
And they wanted to be men
And do some fighting in the street
They said no surrender
No chance of retreat

And so why are we in the taxi
'Cause I didn't want to leave
I said it's High Green, mate
Via Hillsborough, please

Well, drunken plots hatched to jump it
Ask around, are ya sure?
Went for it, but the red light was showing
Red light indicates doors are secured

317,"Am I a monster when I sink my teeth into her
When I don't love her
No, I don't love you
Forgive me darling, but love has nothing to do with this
It has nothing to do with how I can't stop
Until I get what I want from you

This is what real men keep quiet
It doesn't exist if you can hide it behind your teeth
And sleep at night next to your wife
Who you love too much to tell her
You don't love her at all

I just feel as empty as the lungs
Of those waiting in the womb
Do you feel as empty as the lungs of those waiting
To come into this world
Where being beautiful means being used

How long will we blame the devils on our shoulders
And pose like angels on the outside
When all I am is a monster

Ladies and gentlemen
This one goes out to that little kid that got fried Spam for lunch
I feel for you, I'm with you, I'm with you brother
And this one right here is for that ghetto girl with the bad perm
That just burn baby, burn baby, burn
Pop open a malt liquor
Smoke something until your scalp gets killed

Gangstas and pimps
Love lobsters and shrimps
Kool-Aid and chicken
Flashy things and women
All I need
Is Remy and weed
Somebody not afraid
To go some for my Escalade

(Lil Wayne)
I'm just pimping
Baby you got a rule for me
Put your mink on and slide in a cool for me
Hey you gotta get high and go low for me
It's Cash Money young money never know money
It's 500 Degreez it's not fool
But it and the dro got me so scummy
And to drum hole a whole hundred
Can I put a whole hundred in your whole tummy
Hehe, man Weezy's a legend
You can tell by the bottom of my sleeve when you see what's in a bezel
And he be on a level that's so terrific
I'm in this bitch hold your pictures
And hold your bitches 'cause she gon want a part of me
'Cause she never see the roof of my car with me
And you never see a tooth without a diamond on it
This is game at its finest homie
Peep it

(Baby)
See I was born from a gangsta
Pa gave me a whip
Ran numbers with pimps and I laid down cents
One of a kind Birdman I shine
22's on it?
The bitch ain't mine
I taught her the game ma
I gave it all to her
Weezy Wee my son I give it all to him

The Birdman junior I'm the son of a stunna

Jazze Phezzy this our summer
500 Degreez got rich off the four

Flash from hard times from that coke and dope
Put cars in moms name just to duck white folks
We eat lobster and shrimp
Nigga park that Lambo
I'm a V.I.P. nigga
Pop bottles of Mo
I pray that one day I'll open a better door

(Lil Wayne)
Ain't no mountain high enough
To me for 'cause I keep on buying fi-fi stuff
And the Eastside where we pump
It's my part of New Orleans
Bleed for ya I'm the heart of New Orleans
Hear you're fucking with a gangsta foe
Hope you never close your eyes I'll bang your ho
All she need is some guidance I'll tame your ho
It's big pimping over here man yeah man
If she looking for a daddy see the lil man
Weezy baby, don't fool yourself you need me baby
Easy baby, I'm just trying to keep my bread cheesy baby

Who wants another Christian martyr?
Who wants someone else's pain?
Who wants the world on their shoulder?
Who wants to have to cry in vain?
Who wants to have an open sore
Eating away deep inside you?
Who wants to torture themselves
When there's plenty eager to do it for you?
Well, years might heal all the scars
But I don't know if you feel like you have that time
And if I was the man that killed your father
And if I said I'm sorry, would that change your mind?
Well no one should be so surprised

It's teeth for teeth, eyes for eyes

See what I'm talking bout sweet heart you ain't even gotta have John Madden
You ain't gotta have Dick Vitale, you ain't gotta have Lee Carsole
You ain't gotta have Stuart Scott, you ain't gotta have Linda Cohn
Know what I'm talking bout, you ain't gotta have the staff of ESPN
You ain't gotta have the ABC staff just to speak sports baby 'cause I got game sweetheart
Just fuck with the boy and I'll get you a jersey
What you want me to put on the back
Daddy's little girl that's right, know what I'm talking bout
I can't give you the game but I can show the game
And you can see what you see and peek how you peek and see what you get
Know what I'm talking bout

Can you feel the thunder behind my wheels?

One way is my way
Your way, don't even try

Feel my fever burning you up inside
Taste my passion, floor you passing by
Eat my bittersweet dust
Hear my roaring fuel thrust
Ain't no way you're ever, ever getting by

One way is my way
Your way, don't even try

All in all, your time is a'running out
You will just leave here without
Running down on the final pace
Run you out into last place
Fuel me, I can't live without

Withdrawn from reality
Becoming a misantrophe
Summonizing spirits to me
Fighting humanity
No need to watch my back
For they are fighting with me

We match into war slaughtering mankind
If you try to stop us we will give you hell
(From wich we came)
Join us if you dare
Join us if you can
Choose sides,
Or escape to survive

Blood red is the sky
Blood red is the earth
Blood red are the rivers and mountains
That we pass
Black smoke fills the air
From the corpse pyres around
Burning mankind
And have it buried underground


Their funeral pyres, lighting the earth
Smoke blots out the sun, creating eternal night
Gone is humanity, trampled to the ground
Suffocated by the ashes, utopia of thy design

Lend us your sword
And ours will be yours
Give us your strength
And receive it thousandtold
The demon army
Marching over forth
Fulfilling the vision:
An untained world

Don't oppose us... resistance is futile
We annhilate all enemy forces
Nobody can stop us now
Defeat of mankind, a victory of misanthropy

(Intro: Killah Priest (Ty-N))
Uh, yeah, uh uh, uh uh, yo (uh uh uh)
Uh uh, I miss you (Miss you)
To Marcus, uh uh, Kev (Won't forget you)
Y'know I'm sayin'
I C U When I Get There

(Killah Priest)
We came a long way from duckin strays
My niggas laid in the alley ways
Funerals were made, by the beauties sprayed
But now I'm different, somethin' new today
I'm seein bright tunnels, bein My Life, crumbled before
Now I'm restored I wanna see more
Wanna explore, standin by the ocean shore
It looks life heaven just opened it's doors, shinin on me
I'm like a diamond homey (yeah), yo...
So many eulogies we heard, usually leads to the urb'
Ease the nerve, but I believe in readin the word
Takin' head from the man that's feedin the birds
The broaden my horizon, it's hard survivin
I'm job replyin, I keep strivin, I keep tryin'
I'm tryin' to turn defeat to Triumph
There's no place in this jungle for weak lions
Politicians and preachers, they keep lyin'
The streets supplyin, how many times do I have to heat the iron?
Every night there's a gunfight
Fuck misery, I wanna see sunlight
I wanna know at the end that my son's all right
Yo, and to all my fallen soldiers, that's no longer here
I C U When I Get There
I reminisce on the R. Kelly +I Wish+
Yo, right now I'm writin the remix
Y'all heard the stories of the miseries
Rivals between enemies, there's no love or no sympathy
Y'all heard the stories of the stress, death through debts
Project sex and welfare cheques, with Tecs
Automatics, y'all saw the graphics
Well, I know y'all had enough of that shit
I wanna see thrones, I want a land of my own

I want a zone, finally found my way back home
Sit back and relax, readin my poems
While the sunlight hit and gleam off the stones
It's only natural, I want castles and black jewels
I want statues and marble floors
That's what I have toppers for
Open up Solomon doors
Surrounded by priests, scholars and moors
Say my name, dollars just pour
Not that fake paper money
But the coins that they take from mummies
Everybody in my world 'bout the age of 20
Smell a rose, taste the honey, no achin tummies
I could write about my miserable life, critical nights
Fought physical in the spiritual fight
Israelite, mystical type, like a Hindu in white
Let me tell you what my visuals like
Insights of a High Priest, mind's deep as the blue sea
Purple robe, brown Cuffie is all beauty
Absorb the ruby from yours truly, truly

(Outro: Killah Priest (Ty-N))
Yo, I C U When I Get There, yeah (C U When I Get There)
Yo, I C U When I Get There
For all my homies over here (oh no no, I don't know how long it may be)
I C U When I Get There
Pull out to Mark and Kev
Bob Marley here, Marvin Gaye, uh, yo
I C U When I Get There
To all my homies, straight up done over here
I C U When I Get There, yo (I'm just tryin' to make a change to My Life)
You move that, yo
You know 1 and 2ers
On the tracks
Doin' it ups (I know I know I know, you'd like to see your homie)
I C U When I Get There
All the great ones
Marion where you at?
Want you on the track

Awake and paralysed
Forever in one word
Forever is the longest time
It's the only cure I'm not sure I'll survive

Cause you think that you've been living, just treading water
And waiting in the wings for the show to begin
But I always see you searching
As you try that bit harder
Getting closer, oh yeah, to the life you're imagining

Maybe not today, maybe not today
Some day soon you'll be all right

Feels like luck is on your side

No worries, no worries

No worries, no worries

Say it for me, say it for me
(And take all the highs)
We all need somebody

No worries, no worries

No worries, no worries

Say it for me, say it for me

A new inherent

Benign coincidence
We stole our existence

Where river waters are deemed too deep

One kiss, one single kiss
A face outside the window pane
However did it come to this?

A man who ran, a child who cried
A girl who heard, a voice that lied
The sun that burned a fiery red
The vision of an empty bed

The use of force, he was so tough
She'll soon submit, she's had enough
The march of fate, the broken will
Someone is lying very still

He has laughed and he has cried
He has fought and he has died
He's just the same as all the rest
He's not the worst, and he's not the best

And still this ceaseless murmuring
The babbling that I brook
The seas of faces, eyes upraised
The empty screen, the vacant look

A man in black on a snow white horse
A pointless life has run its course
The red rimmed eyes, the tears still run
As he fades into the setting sun

Ilsa: But, Richard, no, I... I...

Rick Blaine: Now, you've got to listen to me! You have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten, we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louie?

Captain Renault: I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist

Ilsa: You're saying this only to make me go

Rick: I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us, we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life

Scrappy navigate the yellow corn height for the barn when the spot light swivel hard right over the farm
Post up
3 cheers for the gimp sprint, thank you
Limp to the door, splint what he mangled
Oh yeah, I knew the percentages but the numbers were unaware of the grand finale's emphasis

I have zero natural enemies

I have no training in reconnaissance, combat or colluding
I'm calling for my orders, over

Klonopin to kill a horse, numb and blood thirsty 'til the 'uncle' spitter beg a jungle pig to hug mercy
Two 40-below shitkickers tickle the corpses
Duck, the widow maker also manufactures orphans
Manufactures ordanance, if it moves stick a fork in it
Winners take all, killers rape all coordinates
Unfortunately courted by the most tenacious guardians whose aimless nature bait a harlequin to taste the martyr skin
No semper fi
No saluter unit, soldier, the fire is more flesh than sulfur
And when the automatic jitters wiggle the ribs, I feel so alive it don't matter which bitches litter is clipped

'Strap on a helmet and start shooting!'

I shimmy up out of the foxhole, disorderly, only after having logged every cadaver accordingly
High scores keep automatons enthralled
There is no cause iller than no cause at all
Okay, if his perspective is merc'd, sneaky detective work is aborted
And it's no longer whisper mode on the red alert
No bed of dirt sniper rifle peaking out the bunker
Now I'm center city looking for something to puncture
Help me up the numbers or the hero status suffers,
Treat the public like a tin can riddled before it plummets,
But adrenaline could lead to lazy eye hassles
So he missed the little boy and
Took the the pin out the pineapple
That's funny
Bumps into the steel toe
That's lovely
Sum it up in 'aw, hell no'
And just as quick as the parachute cable snipped,
I was rag doll horizontal;
Two limbs short of fixed.
Leak a baby pool around the standard issue weaponry
While fading as a blemish in civility's memory,
They will step over the body for the looting...

Extol the power that ""re-grafts the dying vine."" - Romans 11:24 
Another chance to rise and rest in the assurance of hope.

We keep it real, type of chicks we are
Gettin' nice at the bar, bang it loud in your car
I'm from the town, niggas gon' hold me down
Lost but now I'm found, watch me snatch the crown
I clear my throat, ladies spit what I wrote
Takin' off my coat, stuntin' tryin' to poke
We in the back, countin' and peelin' the stacks
Combin' and brushin' the tracks, y'all can't hold me back
I'm comin' out switchin' and changin' your route
Takin' it to the house, bills and large amounts
I got the club bouncin' and shakin' they frames
Glass fillin', puff and then pass, if your feelin' in Philly then dance

Lying on an eiderdown, yippee
You can't see me but I can you

Lazing in the foggy dew
Sitting on a unicorn no fear
You can't hear me but I can you

Watching buttercups cup the light
Sleeping on a dandelion too much
I won't touch you but then I might

Screaming through the starlit skies
Traveling by telephone

I realize to my demise it's better left unsaid 
That columns crash down endlessly and I will end up dead

But all I do is fall 
I victimize my love of life

Unharmed it stares into the sun

Keyholder
For his world I shall enter
My call is answered
By force am I taken to realms, darker than death,
To witness the evil glory I have travelled to see

Many are the appearing shapes of Satan
Unfolding in utter grotesque horror
The air is frozen
I can hear the hateful rumbling and pounding in the
Deep
I can see flickering spectres, silouettes blistering with-
Electric coldness

I breathe spears
Unleashing a pulsating storm of steel
Sulphur floats in my veins
My eyes burn with fury
Carbonised into my heart

Far away, a wast bastard cross manifests in
The air
How dare it shine so clear
Here in these hellish realms?
Oh, did I not know of the impurity...

As the blasphemy becomes unbearable
I behold thousands of claws gripping the
Golden cross from behind
Soon demons crawl like furious ants all over
The profante shape
Screaming in unearthly rage and insanity
The symbol of Nazarene us thirb asunder
Dripping with slime and rot

I shiver in cruel ecstacy
And laugh the madmans laughter

Returning now
With diabolical strength
And a vicious grin in the face

Runs deeper than my bones
I wanna be there for you (I wanna be there for you)

Slow dancing in your eyes
The sun kisses the earth
And I hush my urge to cry
Cry

I wanna be there for you

Runs deeper than my bones

In your masterpiece beautiful

Can't make no sense of what they say
I couldn't tell you if I knew

Don't understand most things I see
In the blue light of the TV
I couldn't tell you what to do

Rita, it all just seems too much
And sometimes maybe not enough
My head is so, so filled up
And Rita, I guess I think too much
Or maybe sometimes not enough
My head is always so filled up

I hold the phone close to my ear
Can't recognize the voice I hear
Couldn't remember what they said

The newspaper stacks up on the step
I can't believe how long I slept
Now why should I get out of bed

Rita, it all just seems too much
And sometimes maybe not enough
My head is so, so filled up
And Rita, I guess I think too much
Or maybe sometimes not enough
My head is always so filled up

There was a thing floating way up there
Was it a wish or another prayer
It was just stuck up in the air

When it is all finally said and done
I start again where I'd begun
In front of rita when I looked dumb

And desperation has many turns
I've been blind to a heart
That's been filled with
Flames I can't let this
Become any worse
Give me times
I'll take my turn

How long do we live awake
Living every day and our
Last mistakes so go on I
Don't need a thing
This will keep me safe
From your soul cold rage

Part of me has died
With its last regret
Damaged by everyone
In sight damned by a lover
But I'll be damned if I
Will leave this place
Without a fight well give
Me time to take my turn
My turn

How long do we live awake
Living every day and
Our last mistakes
So go on I don't need a thing
This will keep me safe
From your soul cold rage

Never mind I know we
Both are waiting
For in our minds
We are blind
And I won't be here
To be the one still crawling at your feet
So why

How long do we live awake
Living every day and our last mistakes
So go on I don't need a thing
This will keep me safe
From your soul cold rage

Living everyday with your soul cold rage

396,"Dear Dad, the class began, hands were held and arms were open
Moments stolen from the globe and life's blood was always spoken
One was chosen for another. Broke my will against your wisdom
Pushed my face towards the light so I could cultivate the vision
Made decisions for the unit. Hard times, you moved us through it
By each word and every movement, you're the one who showed me what truth is
Thanks for the blueprint passed down. I'll grip it by the cover
Plus you showed me how to love my wife by the way you treat my mother
And Mom, you sacrificed your body, scarred beneath the weight
To usher my soul into the universe, human contact, you were first
Through the worst I had to offer, caught his mercy in your stare
You were there. Patched my wounds an protected me with your prayers
Gave me food when I was hungry. Gave me love when I was empty
Gave me a look of knowing solitude when I said where God would send me
Thanks for the days and the nights, the laughter and the fights
Teaching me wrong from right, Mom, the first woman in my life
To my brother, thanks for the beatdowns and the harassment
In you I learned to express my views with heated passion
Followed your footsteps good or bad, so please get the facts straight
My big brother introduced me to this and gave me my first rap tape
I watched you grow up, thrive, prosper and self destruct
Find the jewel in circumstances that sucked but still you stuck
A husband and a father, a brother and a son
Kevin, I'm so proud of the man that you've become
Pam, Jeff, Billy, Cliff, Paine, David, Terry, Chris, Ricky
The names stick with me, the names stick with me
Jason Lee, Ben Heaton, Josh Cleveland, Eric Sartain
Trent Gibson saw the best and the worst I've ever given
Sintax, I'd bend back the sky and shift the balance
I thank you for your strong mind, your friendship and your talent
Your example to all that witness 'cause there's no ""I"" in crew
You inspire me brother 'cause I can see Christ in you
Dust, where to start? The art's answer to my question
Blessed from lessons together that's always led to progression
This profession needs your genius to show cats what it's about
You keep making the music and I'll keep running my mouth
Playdough, Harry Krum, enough heart for every alias
Thanks for helping me carry the torch as we take these kids
Listener, Illtripp, Fred B, Recon
Rabbi, Manuel, Sev Statik and Sivion
It's on until we change the face and finish what we started
I'm thankful that you're all a part of this
Yeah it's on until we change expression, finish what we started
Deepspace5, it's never stopping
Mary, I don't have the words to get across my feelings
I breathe a purer form of oxygen when I'm staring at your face
I can rise above my limits and break through this vaulted ceiling
I'm a better man today because you occupy my space
I hit the road, you hold it down and shun the glory
I'll be the mouthpiece for your heart and I'll tell the world our story
Thanks for bearing our children. Thanks for sharing your life
Thanks for saying, ""Yes,"" May. Thanks for being my wife
To my daughters and all unborn and future seeds
I look at the world through your eyes and you always help me see
Inspiration in your innocence and the future in your face
I write these songs so I can make your world a better place
And that's all to say that all that I am is a collection of souls
That God has used to touch me. Changed a reflection
Made a man from a simple stick-figure
And if I've ever met you, then you helped him paint the picture...

Talk trash and really got a choice like Sophie
So O.G. never caught livin' the movie
Wards real life, just ""Being Myself"", like Juve

My lucky ass mind got me in the newest fashion
Rap blastin, silver surfer on the glide
My horse kick just like a Colt 45
Man all up in ya mind like a Cartier design
And I'll be standin right behind when your credit card decline
Get outta line, I spin a web like a spider
Man hit the ice house in the middle yell, ""Fire!""
Man do it how you wanna man and take it how you gonna
Cause all you gonna hear is, ""No contest your honor""
I live the life style of the wild crocidile
Man pull you under water then I giggle when you drown
Man it's nothin' that the lawlal, take it with a frown
My mugshot befor they took the picture had the smile
Man holla at me now, four or five rounds
Cuttin' through the make up just to shake up these clowns

Straight gangsta boogie, from here to Tokyo

If you know me from back I kept it crackin' since little leauge
I swing the bat and I love to sing and rap
On the track and I be the one you point your finger at

Man like seven day though milk man I make 'em all expire
Hands up in the flame man and lust for the game
And even if I'm cripple and I'm walkin' with a cane

I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen

Where do we go from here?
The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
And where are you?
They brought in the CIA
The tanks and the whole marines to blow me away
To blow me sky high

My baby's got the bends
We don't have any real friends

I'm just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend waiting for something to happen

Let me see those big ass hips, big booty, pump it up...

Down south playas, we got that fire, mayne!
Get up on my booty, tootie fruite on the rudy
I'm a thick chick, skinny girls act snooty,
No matter what the size, my big thighs, I do my duty,
Look at the way my rump like shake like a movie (?)
See my tight jeans and the coochie,
Spend a little loochie, gotta work for the booty,
Me and Nelly hot on the track, Nelly, can't no one ever top that,
'Cause we came to rock the club, DJ's betta pump it up,
Muthafuckas need to back it up, 'cause we gon tear the roof off the club,

(Missy talks) you know down south chicks got big asses, and we a little heavy sometimes, but when you from the south, we don't call that 'fat', we call that 'big-boneded', fo' sho'

(Nelly)
Yeah ma, I heard you like the magic stick,
Me I got that gadget stick, it's like go-go gadget dick,
You know, make her climb the walls shit,
I make her wanna press pause and shit,
Walk up in the party, girls swingin' they panties,
You see they was doin' that before I had them grammy's,
I get a little baby when I'm in Miami, I may act a little fresh but I still got mannies
It's Nelly phelony, and Missy, Misdemeanor,
Both goin' down, ????
I got records, that got records that broke records in record time and I ain't talkin' 'bout them records they buyin,
Lyin', see ya need to keep up wit me,
You see I'm still spendin (?), stackin the ride wit me,
You struggle to recoup, I struggle on which coupe to ride in,
(Missy) SEE HOW WE BE STYLIN'

This is fire...

",5
416,"Caught in space and time
Like a bird in a cage
Cruelly confined
In a passing matters state

You suddenly realize
That the wrong is the right
Daring the laws
Ready to put up a fight
But...

Love will drag your heart away
To a world where dreams are made
Can't hide away
When your helpless mind obeys

Together we wait in silence
(Still are the cries)
Forever the fate is hungry
For your soul
Together we wait in silence
(Still are the cries)
Worth your while until you're gone

All the secrets of life reveal
To my eyes I can't conceal
And again I fly away
To a world where dreams are made

Together we wait in silence
(Still are the cries)
Forever the fate is hungry
For your soul
Together we wait in silence
(Still are the cries)
Worth your while until you're gone

Life's too short to grieve in sorrow
(Still are the cries)
Fate is waiting for your soul
(Secrets inside)
Live your life like no tomorrow
(Still are the cries)
Worth you're while until you're gone

Fate's gonna take your soul!

Talkin' 'bout charmed, baby

Must be a potion
Gotta be a pill
Gotta be somethin' that can cure me of these chills

419,"Dark skies and I'm drowning in the flood again.
Endless affliction sent to torture my soul.
Why does this misery follow me?
Why can't I escape this pain?
Drill another hole through my skull.
Release another demon.
Take any length to pass the blame.
Responsibility - washed my hands clean.
Demons in the night?
Self-righteous perception.
Defensively, I hide blind in the shadows.
Misery cuts deep and yet my innocent hands hold the blood soaked knife.
Every action leads to reaction, every choice to a consequence.
Foolish decisions yield a price to pay.
Pass the blame and yet the debt remains.
Wipe the scales from my eyes that I might gain clarity of sight.
With a new perspective I take ownership of my actions,
The impending flood now seems a healthy rain.
Pain is inevitable but misery is optional.
Suffering and pain will fade away as hope lives on and love remains.

420,"<b>Mr. Money:</b>
I woke up today
Expecting to find all that I sought
And climb the mountains of the life I bought
Finally I'm at the top of every hierarchy
Unfortunately there is no one left
But me

I woke up today
To a world that's ground to dust, dirt and stone
I'm the king upon this withering throne
I ruled every forest, every mountain, every sea
Now there're but ruins left to rule for me
And... you see, it beckons me;
Life turned its back on us
How could you just agree?
...How? I just don't see...

I woke up today
To a world devoid of forests and trees
Drained of every ocean, every sea
Just like a useless brick upon the shore
The morning after the storm
That swept the bridge away
Relentless tide
No anger
Just this relentless time
That calls us all on
But...

I'm never crossing that line
Leaving this world behind
I will stay on my own
On this bloodstained throne
I rule the ruins and wrecks
And the dust, dirt and stone
I rule rage rod and rattling of bones

<i>Solo</i>

I am on my own
I am all alone
Everything is gone
Stuck forever here
Already cold

I'm never crossing that line
Leaving this world behind
I will stay on my own
On this bloodstained throne...

I'm never crossing that line
Leaving this world behind
I will stay on my own
On this bloodstained throne...

I'm never crossing that line
Leaving this world behind
I will stay on my own
On this bloodstained throne
I rule the ruins and wrecks
And the dirt and the dust and the stone
I'm the ruler of rage rod and rust
And the rattling of bones
Ruler of ruin
I rule the ruins (<i>ad lib</i>)

I'm never crossing that line
Leaving this world behind
I will stay on my own

421,"I notice that you mentioned your opinion
Oh, now they got a couple of things to say too
What should I do?
Listen or leak crimson?
All over the floor from my wrists
There, now you've got Lif
Some natural, authentic, completely genetic
Inherited fate trait
He was eclectic but he didn't make great
Status is a trendy little song on a dub plate
Give it some spins and it begins to wither
My nigga
What's up, my nigga?
Let's show and prove
Make moves this winter
Rent a whip and start riding
Look into my eyes and see those two worlds colliding
I wanna be home making records
Now I'm in the studio and all I wanna do is be home
(What's stopping you?) Who's that?!
Move back!
Drive me to the hospital, I'm at the point of collapse

Sorry, baby girl, your man is out on tour
The floor may drop out if I don't walk out
Handle my B.I.
See, I think I might have just missed my own life 'cause I'm working tonight
And the pressure {*4X*}
Sales, interviews, touring, performing at my peak
Man, I need sleep {*2X*}

Now what truly defines one's life?
Is it the legacy they left behind?
Well, this music seems to be mine
It's been nine interesting years in the game
Not too much has changed
I've still got a saw to hack up your frame
Performed at all your favorite festivals
Some cats do one show and blow
My destiny to live on the low
It's got me locked in the basement
In the winter in December
Open window, cold toe
Face down on the futon rocking yesterday's attire
Woke up early feeling uninspired
Staring at my album outline
At this point I've drafted up about nine
New Lif, yeah, it's about time
Maybe you've seen me on stage with Ace, Came to Perceptionists
Or read an article on how my verbal weapon is
Well, regardless how you got here, feel fear
Kick the kick, stomp the snare, goodbye the hi
Watch the rhythm die then resurrect
As I recollect
Ancient black intellect
Erase and redirct
Your collective minds to check a selective rhyme
Detail
Available at retail, griotmatics
Ipod and Treo addicts gotta have it
It's black magic that'll wrinkle time's fabric
Have you heard of Lif?
Well, maybe, sorta, perhaps
Listen up and let me guide you to the point of collapse

422,"It's the perfect time of year
Somewhere far away from here
I feel fine enough, I guess
Considering everything's a mess
There's a restaurant down the street
Where hungry people like to eat
I could walk but I'll just drive
It's colder than it looks outside

It's like a dream you try to remember but it's gone
Then you try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn
When you try to see the world beyond your front door
Take your time 'cause the way I rhyme's gonna make you smile
When you realize that a guy my size might take a while
Just to try to figure out what all this is for

It's the perfect time of day
To throw all your cares away
Put the sprinkler on the lawn
And run through with my gym shorts on
Take a drink right from the hose
And change into some drier clothes
Climb the stairs up to my room
Sleep away the afternoon

It's like a dream you try to remember but it's gone
Then you try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn
When you try to see the world beyond your front door
Take your time 'cause the way I rhyme's gonna make you smile
When you realize that a guy my size might take a while
Just to try to figure out what all this is for

Pinch me, pinch me
'Cause I'm still asleep
Please God, tell me
That I'm still asleep

On an evening such as this
It's hard to tell if I exist
Pack the car and leave this town
Who'll notice that I'm not around?
I could hide out under there
I just made you say 'underwear'
I could leave but I'll just stay
All my stuff's here anyway

It's like a dream you try to remember but it's gone
Then you try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn
When you try to see the world beyond your front door
Take your time 'cause the way I rhyme's gonna make you smile
When you realize that a guy my size might take a while

424,"Dawg you gotta feel me on this one
What it be like dawg, I'm on some some adope grown up type shit
Look who I be around nigga, look who I been around nigga
Geezy, Juve and Turk, B and Slim dawg pay attention dawg

Age is nothin' but some digits nigga trust me on this
Cas I think I speak for every one when I say life is a bitch
I ride D L in the C L Gun right in my grip
I slip a clip in every whip, cas hatas likely to trip
Come home to my future wife and every night she'll flip
She end up catchin bites to her lips behind diapers and shit
But I light me a spliff drink henney without ice when I'm pissed
Go to the club and start a fight thinkin' I'm Tyson and shit
But I'm a man so I'm here to handle my situtions correctly
And I know I might be young but niggas gone definitely respect me
But in the mean time I'm fightin gun charges in court
And in a couple of weeks our next tour about to start
It's like I'm never happy now
Except for the fact my daughter sayin' I love you daddy now
And that kinda juice me up and I smoke about 3 blunts
And puff a Kool it boost me up
And say a prayer for everyday
Just so I get through the stuff but I be like

Ah man, it's complicated doin' everythang on your own man
Being responsible for everybody in ya home man
And when you feel like everythang is goin' wrong man
I'm gone stand 'cause I am a GROWN MAN

I try to keep my head up, but I die to keep my bread up
And usually I'm fed up thinkin' everythang's a set up
But I get up this shit, stick out my chest and clutch on my nuts
And I get hit up with all kinda stress
And put up wit the stuff trust me it's tough
But I mantain to climb through it all
And I still manage to be Lil Wayne therefore I shine and I ball
And dawg I live for today and hope and pray that there's a tomorrow
And I borrow confidence from out my heart when thangs get awfall
And I'm walkin' on the edge stuck without a solution
And someway I still pick it out and shuffle to conclusion
And I don't need nobody else so keep yo advice and jus doubt me
Cas y'all cats don't really no me y'all jus no 'bout me
So if my dawgs be on my side they keep me covered with spirit
And plus I know my fathers watchin and my mother's the dearest
And I ain't neva said they don't appreciate what I do
But jus know if I wasn't a man I wouldn't make it through

Who would have known that this was somthin that didn't turn out so hectic
But I chose my own life so I gradually accept it
I'm influenced and effected by the way it became
And I don't play with them at all so I don't say it's a game
And even though I grew up hard and I have gracefully change
I'm always street so I'll forever be facin a change
And I'll keep this thang brutained on the waist of my pants
And I demand respect from all if not then I'm waisten a man
And if I want it then I get and if I need it I have it
Take care of them family first 'cause the liquir and weed is a habit
And I'm so often I'm congratulated for the succeeding at last
But when they turn they back I just have Jesus leadin my path
And I didn't ask for you to like me I don't care if you hate me
But don't mistake me no otha man can neva make me or break me
And I'm faithfully inspired by the hood tell I'm gone
And dawg I do believe I'm grown
So I'll be good on my own but I be like

Play the low and kill you softly like Roberta Flack
And then they, And then they mad 'cause I'm stating facts
And then they, And then they hate when I cop the cat

In the ring with the thing thing, make me twist your cap
You fools is selling your soul for a little plaque
Let's take it back to the hood where niggas is shooting craps
And everybody rapping, we ain't do it for the stacks

Gotta stay on my toes and I ain't afraid of that
You niggas pimp on, I leave you where your gators at
This is for every person that I owe, I'm paying back
And every nigga turned groupie, I know you heard of that
People that smiled in my face and talked behind my back
For every dream that got lost, I promise I'm winning back
To all my peoples that knocked, we gone bounce back
And all the babies in the hood, gotta announce that
I can't give up, I won't give up, I crown myself the champ
So I don't think y'all want to see me when I'm really amped

Next to me was this stunt named Lynn
She's cute, long hair, light skin
And she's married to my homeboy Ken
Hey, it's all right, she says Ken don't know
Yeah, Ken don't know you're a hoe
But oh, you're wonderin, how could I sleep with Lynn?

Still felt skanless, so I called Beth

But Beth was my homeboy Ken's mother

I'ma pick you up around a quarter to 6
So wear somethin' sexy and cute
'Cause I'm about to crash the boots""
She said, ""You need to because pops can't hang no more""
10 minutes later I was knockin' at the door
She opened up, I said, ""What's up""
She said, ""My husband's inside,"" I said, ""What the - hold up
Just wait, I'ma go away and let you handle this""
?????? The mack 'cause I'm skanless

Yo, it's a girl named Vicky
She kinda knows my rep so I had to get slick, see?
I had to turn like super skanless on her
(But yo, I know I love you, baby) you know, that Compton drama
She said, ""We can't make love 'cause I'm not like that
I have to get to know you,"" all the yakety yak crap
I said, ""Baby, I feel my heart crackin' up
I really thought you liked me so I bought you this
Luxurious solid gold bracelet
Go 'head, put it on, let me see if it fits""
She says, ""Ooh, I guess you're serious""
""I mean what can you say? I mean you drive me delirious
If we make love I buy you anything you want
Dookie gold ropes, silk suits to flaunt""
I knocked boots, she made me feel like a mack
So like a pimp I jacked the hoe and stole all my shit back

Cause rarely do I see niggaz that be comin' with that funky ass shit
That make you say fuck ay, go shoot a nigga down,
But here comes that black nigga that they call Ren
Makin' niggaz go and act crazy again
Niggaz be fuckin' fools for the hell of it
Some down old niggaz better not come this way
'Cause I just don't give a fuck, 'cause I get in a baby gangsta mode
Bitch slappin niggaz with my fist
'Cause I insist I'm a hell of a lyricist
But my roots in the street
Killin' playa haters over some wicked ass beats
Me and my niggaz come and get your ass
Then me and my niggaz beat up on that ass
Cause me and my niggaz, nigga love the creep
When the shit gets deep, it gets deep

Doo doo doo doo

Oh doo doo hmm
Oh doo doo doo doo

I prayed heaven today
Would bring its hammer down on me
And pound you out of my head
I can't think with you in it

I'd drag all that I owned
Down the dirt road to find you
And my shoes, worn-out and used
They can't take me much farther
Oh

Something always takes the place of missing pieces
You can take and put together even though
You know there's something missing

The sun burned a hole in my roof
I can't seem to fix it
And I hope rain doesn't come
Wash me down the gutter

Something always takes the place of missing pieces
You can take and put together even though
You know there's something missing

She rides in a car
Like a queen on a card
And the guns of her mind
Aim a line straight at mine
To a heart that is broke
Tried to feel but got choked
In the smoke of a desert
A beach with no treasure
A night that seems blue
Feed the aching in you
And the background birds
Take a flight from the earth
A bonfire burns
And the night current turns
On a lifeboat floating
Down a river of sleep
Can't see her hollow eyes
Walking along with my boots full of rocks
Can't believe these tears of mine
I give 'em to you to keep away in a box

Something always takes the place of missing pieces
You can take and put together even though
You know there's something missing

Something always missing
Always someone missing something
Something always missing
Always someone missing something
Something always missing
Always someone missing something
Something always missing

Horrible dreams to grab my sleep
Whatever I do, wherever I go
They're always near beside

If these turn up there ain't no joy
All I can's detroy
If these turn up there ain't no joy
Nothing works to scare 'em away

Black cats, black cats
Always scary, how do I lose em'
Black cats, black cats
An evil omen - Black cats

Stumbling through the streets at night
I was overcome again by this bothersome plague
It didn't come off it's over now
This was the final show

All I can's detroy
If these turn up there ain't no joy

Drag the system down
Now, I don't see no lights I don't taste no spit. Silent flash, hear the bang I'm gonna get my blues
Just feel it
No going back
Just kill it
Of holding hands
Just feel it
With you, the circus comes

Uh-huh, uh-huh, UH...

106 and Park ain't been the same since I had it

So I'm back at it - freeze

Still a +juvenile+ at +400 Degrees+

Lil' girls still fallin' out, I'm still ballin'

Crawlin' out the hottest speeds on these ATL streets

From the Garden, to the box office, I shuts down both

And no matter where I go I'm still, O-H-I-Oh

E'rybody know this is MY turf!

Who had it crunk first, and had girls of all ages off one verse?

(YOU!) Ain't nobody else can name

Another seventeen year-old manye that do it this HARD

""Oh LORD"", that's what them old niggaz say about me

Young niggaz play, can't go a day without me

If bling was a drug, I'd DIE from an overdose

Fresh Prince to Sugarloaf, Homey I'm the most you've seen

I got the same affects on both coasts

And e'rything hot on fo' wheels, homey I'm ghost



Do you - stop tryna be me, stop tryna be he

Stop tryna do what you see

Do you - 'Cause right here is my love homey

Go back to where you came from and get yo own homey

Do you - It's so-so sloppy and the fans know a copy

When they see one, I would neva wanna be one

Do you - As long as it sound right

E'rybody in town like it

Don't worry 'bout nobody else, else

Do you



Not just the rap game, the whole industry the same

E'rybody wanna look and sound like the next manye

But I'm definite there ain't another me

And I'm So-So-Definite, back wit J.D

Back to give these little imitators sumthin' to talk on

Breathe, Stretch, let it go, homey get yo walk on!

Black Beat, Teen People, can't forget Right On!

A lotta things changed since the young don's been gone

What chug on roll with? The future is me!

Only youngins that's movin' units is.ugh.ME

Young Ali, float like a butterfly

Get up out them stores quick, why wouldn't you wanna buy?

The carbon copy, not the copy

Imitators mimic, but them guys is sloppy, heh, heh

As for me, I'm the leader of the new school

I can just ad-just, so the rest of y'all just



Do you - stop tryna be me, stop tryna be he

Stop tryna do what you see

Do you - 'Cause right here is my love homey

Go back to where you came from and get yo own homey

Do you - It's so-so sloppy and the fans know a copy

When they see one, I would neva wanna be one

Do you - As long as it sound right

E'rybody in town like it

Don't worry 'bout nobody else, else

Do you



(Jermaine Durpi - talking)

See?!

It's rare to find people like us...

Everybody out there doin' what I'm doin'!

Or tryna do what I'm doin', you can't man!

At one point in ya life, man, you gotta get in yo own lane and stop swervin' in mine!

See what I do, I do my way!

What about you, huh?! HUH?! CAN YOU SAY THAT?!



Do you - stop tryna be me, stop tryna be he

Stop tryna do what you see

Do you - 'Cause right here is my love homey

Go back to where you came from and get yo own homey

Do you- [Choir singing]

Don't affect us at all

Watch their world through dying eyes
Lost their pride and lost their will to live

Condemn drink
Condemn everything before you think

And love is rare
Love is all we need to get us there

While my brain's exploding I'll just sit and smile
We bring ourselves to the brink of disaster
Then find a way to do it faster

Money rules
Money is dangerous in the hands of fools
Lonely eyes
Lonely stares
Lonely people, but no one cares
Kill that man
Kill that wife
Kill yourself to find a better life
Pray at dinner
Pray at night

Because deadlines and tests and fucked up kids
Have transformed high school into a house of fears.
And if the budget keeps blocking sunlight we can't help these growing trees.
And I doubt that the integral of blah blah blah is what I fucking need.
So I'll take my pencil, break it on my head.
There's no use in knowing how long Calvin Coolidge's been dead
If you're not getting real education go complain
Because we deserve all that we want.
Term papers declare them useless, I'll get them off the net.
I don't remember a single thing my 8th grade teachers said
Except the propagandist dittos they told me to read.
Such a paucity of free thought. I must believe what they believe.
So I'll take those dittos and burn them till they're dead.
Hooray for Operation Desert Storm is what they said.
On my Brit Lit quizzes I just guessed. I'll believe everything I want.
In school they constantly reminded me
That I wasn't smart enough and that I wasn't cool.
In school they rarely tell you there's more to life than school.
Well I learned how to add and anti-differentiate.
Well I learned the formula for Sodium Benzoate.
Well I learned the 1 chord to the 5 is a half cadence.
I learned how to ask how to piss in English and Spanish.
We have to take some time to just forget about our classes.
Seize the day it doesn't matter if we fall on our asses.
'Cause you'll learn that g=9.8 and w=mg
But I rarely get a thing from class that helps me become me.
So raise your hand high, say what you wanna say.
And if they condemn and fail you you will still be ok.
Just be yourself and succeed anyway.

I cry, I cried my life away

There's a jukebox a-playin'
A half a block down
Singing I'm going to the river
I'm gonna jump on in and drown
But I ain't gonna do it, no
Just gonna keep on hanging around

Oh it's all over
Oh it's all over
All over
Now, now, now, now

But outside her window
A pretty bird comes to play
And I know, I know I must have cried a teardrop
Because I scared that pretty little thing right on away

When I see two young lovers
Walkin' down the street
It just hits me
When I see their two lips meet
Oh I put my head
Right over where my heart used to be, 'cause

You give me hope, to carry on.
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song.

Rollin' at sea, adrift on the waters
Could it be finally, I'm turning for home
Finally a chance to say, ""Hey, I Love You""
Never again to be all alone.

And you light up my life,
You give me hope, to carry on.
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song.

To leave this dead space, with hatred so alive

Writhing with sickness
Thrown into banality
I decay, killed by the weakness
But forced to return

Turn it off

I watch the stars as they fall from the sky
I held a fallen star and it wept for me, dying
I feel the fallen stars encircle me
Now as they cry

Out there, so quickly, grows malignant tribes
Post-human extinction excels unrecognized

Feeling surrounded
So bored with mortality
I decay, all of this hatred 
Is fucking real

Turn it on

I watch the stars as they fall from the sky
I held a fallen star and it wept for me, dying
I feel the fallen stars encircle me
Now as they cry

It won't be all right

Just watch the stars tonight as they
As they disappear, disintegrate

Cause this hate is fucking real
And I hope to shade the world

Try to hide from what's 
Creeping and crawling and stabbing within! 
Try to deny the turmoil inside 
If you fight yourself hard enough 
You'll never win any ounce of serenity 
Or a calm hope at best 
Or a calm hope at best 
Can leave you heaving on the floor 
Gasping for breath, 
Are you gasping for breath? 
To be left on the floor gasping for breath 

You're either the person you are 
Or the person you're trying, trying, trying, trying to be 
Don't let the outside sway too far 
From where you want to be 

And at any cruel moments notice 
You can ruin the best 
As your body is brutally pressed 
Against the confines of your tense flesh 
And if you close your eyes tight enough 
Then none of the bad can get, none of the bad can get in 
And if you close your eyes tight enough 
Then none of the light can get, none of the light can get in 
The light can't get in, the light can't get in! 

Boom! You scream as the light hits you 
It radiates throughout your whole soul 

Boom! The pain is clarity, it cleanses 
And if it still fucking hurts 
Then you still fucking know, 
That you are still alive, 
That you are still in control, if you would only take hold 

Boom! The day with both hands, a death grip 
And a good chance to outlive your past 
Are you living free, are you living free? 

You're either the person you are 
Or the person you're trying, trying, trying, trying to be 
Don't let the outside sway too far

So you can catch the prime example of those who rock right

Castin' shadows the size of Mount Shasta beadore I smash ya

I put my pressure on the corners and cave the box in
There's homicide on my breath and rhyme circles of sin
See if I don't re-animate the meat grinders grain
In the 8 wing where grey veins protrude from my grey rings
My collection of strange things include:
A barreling delivery like a Winchester and a pool full of crude
Oil in my turmoil ridden block of ill rhythm
Where cracker cockroaches talk about class division
See I'm not stuck in a strucked out function
I adapt to the place I hear the bass bumpin'
Keep every rhyme different, that's a sign of a vetran
Keep a bag of Buc Fifties in my cabinet of medicine

Mad Child
Make sure the door's locked and your deadbolt's fastened
Your worst nightmare that shares no compassion
Acid falshbacks get hacked up into fractions
Sergeant's road kill, still missing in action
An unafferctionate date, I'm section eight
Let's play, you be the bride of death and decay
Do you stay awake at night thinking of the things you should worry about?
Follow this blood trail and hurdle through the forest of doubt, till I'm out
In the wide open plains, hopin' to maintain
The same yield, but the field's littered with corpses
Death is my departure, till then I'm explosive
An overdose of death, spare me no thrill
I'm rare, bare me no ill will, I'm there
The last man standing, never call a truce
Apologize? Nah, strength needs no excuse

Riding dirty gray horses, go you and I.
Mating with chance, copulating with mirth
The sad-glad paymasters (for what it's worth).

The ice-cream castles are refrigerated;
The super-marketeers are on parade.
There's a golden handshake hanging 'round your neck,
As you light your cigarette on the burning deck.

And you balance your world on the tip of your nose
Like a sealion with a ball, at the carnival.

You wear a shiny skin and a funny hat
The almighty animal trainer lets it go at that.
You bark ever-so-slightly at the trainer's gun,
With you whiskers melting in the noon-day sun.

You flip and you flop under the big white top
Where the long-legged ring-mistress starts and stops.
But you know, after all, the act is wearing thin
As the crowd grows uneasy and the boos begin.

But you balance your world on the tip of your nose
You're a sealion with a ball at the carnival.

Just a trace of pride upon our fixed grins
For there is no business like the show we're in.
There is no reason, no rhyme, no right
To leave the circus 'til we've said good-night.

The same performance, in the same old way;
It's the same old story to this passion play.
So we'll shoot the moon, and hope to call the tune
And make no pin cushion of this big balloon.

Look how we balance the world on the tips of our noses,
Like sealions with a ball at the carnival.

Siempre listo, me fijo en todo
I'm one bad motherfucker from the wrong side of town ese, ni modo

Cruising with the 45's, got my loaded .45's still living this Crazy Life

Nothing like I used to see, drug deals everyday homie
Overdoses? Yeah usually, but the streets was so damn good to me
Pain the walls with graffiti, all the vatos acting rough with me
So rough so tough with me, pinche juras handcuffing me
They never left me alone, just 'cause I was pelon
And because of my skin-tone, fuck that must be 'cause I'm chingon
And I tell it like it is, my shit's bad damn right it is
Can't believe how tight it is, like baby Jennifer Lopez
Leaving all you fools so please, knowing you can't fuck with this
Say that you don't like my shit, your fucked and now you're stuck with it
I know that you're bumping it, on the down low you be loving it

But don't let no one get you down, don't frown
Ready for showdowns, I got more sold than MoTown bumping in your town
Who's got the flows now? Who's running the shows now?
The wicked wicked Lil' Rob gots it all under control now
Go now, if you know what's good for you
But you're one of those vatos that likes to talk away
If you had any sense you'd swallow your foolish pride homey and walk away
The other way, oh by the way I fly away ddaammnnn to my four corner room
Like my song 4 Corner Room, tripping out like I was on shrooms
I sit and look at the colorful things, evil, good or whatever it brings
Spread my wings and fly away again, Lil' Rob the San Diegan
Let me know when you want to play again, play again
Maybe next year on the Fifth of May again, May again
But until then keep up with Lil' Rob year round
And I'm promising you the crystal clear sound of a Mexican
But it's time for me to go rest again
It's time for me to go but I'll be back to flow
Remember my name, Lil' Rob
Know where I'm from, San Diego

So somethin' tells me... either yo' mama done change her number...

How could you do this to me after all these years?

Always tryna play around and tell lies while you are not at home
Sorry girl, you busted now, I saw the number on yo' cell phone, you cheatin'

But this time it's different, I know I ain't trippin'
I looked in the cell phone, saw another man's digits

(Mr. Diggs)
Now, you must be trippin', 'cause you know it's not the same
She caught you from her mama house and maybe her number changed

No, she got the two-thousand minute plan, callin' her minuteman

Really wanted you to be my wife

Can't, think of nothing that rhyme wit', fifteen

Far away from it all,
There is a place you go
Where teardrops fall.

Far away in the stormy night,
Far away and over the wall,
You are there in the flickering light
Where teardrops fall.

We banged the drum slowly
And played the fife lowly
You know the song in my heart
Bridge: In the turning of twilight
In the shadows of moonlight
You can show me a new place to start

I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup
Strippin' away at it all,
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Where teardrops fall.

By rivers of blindness,
In love and with kindness
We could hold up a toast if we meet
Bridge: To the cuttin' of fences
To sharpen the senses
That linger in the fireball heat.

Roses are red, violets are blue
And time is beginning to crawl,
I just might have to come see you
Where teardrops fall.

Marx discussed this idea in Das Kapital when he refers to religion as being the opiate of the people. It is painfully obvious that this allusion to religion can be applied to anything that citizens follow blindly, whether it be radical ideology because of its inherent shock value, patriotism, television idols, or media instilled demagogues. The citizen must learn that the truth will not be spoon-fed to them. The citizen must learn the beauty of doubt, for all they have to lose is their chains.)

Cause yesterday my partner got jacked fo' his Benz

Cause all black folks do is smoke marijuana

(Bow Wow)

I had a homey named Tony, sixteen, six two

Headed to the NBA straight from high school

My nigga had his ball game on lock

But at the same time, he was in love with the block

All the stuff that came wit it, the drugs and the guns

The gangs, the slang and all the funds

He just got a letter of contempt from the Cavaliers

Sayin' how they love him and they wish he was there

He had +it made+ like +Special Ed+, about to get the bread

But chose, to do, sumthin' dumb instead

Go to war with the crew on the other side of town

And was mo' ready, and Tony got laid down

He ain't even have a chance

Died before the ambulance, even got to him

So many went through him

I hate to tell the story, but that's how it is

Growin' up in the hood as a kid



When you got big dreams, don't listen to what nobody say

And don't let nobody turn you away

When you got big dreams, keep your eyes on the prize

Don't fall to the waste side (""even-even if they look lost forever"")

I knew this girl named Gina that was a hell of a singer

And everybody fell in love with her when they seen her

Baby girl was on the verge of signing a big deal

Eighteen, and life looked so-so real

She was stuck wit a dude that was all bad news

And all he ever did was give baby the blues

But she was true to a nigga, do for a nigga

Pop you and ya whole crew for a nigga

One night he came, picked her up told her, ""let's ride!""

That's the same night that he watched her die!

They was tryna hit a lick, but the lick hit back

Put a end to the deal, and all of that

She ain't even have to be there, he know it wha'nt right

Now he gotta deal with it for the rest of his life

And the part I don't like, he ain't even get graze

But homegirl, Gina, is layin' in the grave





I got a few relatives given family drama

Always got they hands out when they see me and my momma

One coulda been a doctor, the other a chef

But when he got his own kitchen, he was cookin' sumthin' else

Now his life in the drain, a triflin' shame

He all washed up, wife took e'rything

No car, no mo', no HOUSE

And everywhere he go, he stole, so they throwed him out

I was growin' up, lookin' up to be like them

Now I'm throwin' up cash, rollin' up in the Bent

I was stuck wit a dream I had since a shorty

I be DAMNED if I let another man support me, now

Uncle Junebug's sick, skinny as hell

He got AIDS in his body from the needles he shared

E'rytime he get his welfare checks, he don't care

You wanna see him go to the crack house, he there

Thank god that you were by my side
To hold me when I cried

I wanna be strong
But I don't wanna be alone tonight
I wanna believe that I can save the world
And make it right
But I believe that you've got a hero's face
Right here in your arms is safest place
The safest place

It feels so real
You showed me I could trust you
With emotions I had locked away
It was your touch, your words
They hear the deepest part of me
That only you can see

I wanna be strong
But I don't wanna be alone tonight
I wanna believe that I can save the world
And make it right
But I believe that you've got a hero's face
Right here in your arms is the safest place

As long as I'm with you
As long as I can feel you
That's all I need to keep me going
On and on and on and on...
I wanna believe that I can save the world
And make it right
But I believe that you've got a hero's face
Right here in your arms is the safest place

Right here in your arms is the safest place...

The safest place...

Now watch me stumble and come undone
If you take away these memories
Then all that's left is just me

'Cause I don't want this
And I don't need this
And I don't feel this
It seems that even though she's with me
I can't shake this
And I can't fake this
And I won't take this anymore

So you choose to break my heart
I should have seen this from the start
I'm haunted by your apathy
All that's left is killing me

'Cause I don't want this
And I don't need this
And I don't feel this
It seems that even though she's with me
I can't shake this
And I can't fake this
And I won't take this anymore

Do you believe that the way you choose to be
I've always had to see
The brighter side of this so I don't lose my faith
Now the sun has gone away
It's getting colder every day
So before I freeze to death there's something I should say

'Cause I don't want this
And I don't need this
And I don't feel this
It seems that even though she's with me
I can't shake this
And I can't fake this
And I won't take this anymore
And though you say you understand
You still won't face this
Can't erase this
I won't embrace this anymore

Rain falling around me
Lookin' down at a worm
With a long way to go
And the traffic was hissing by
And I was homesick
And I was high

I was surrounded by a language
In which I could say only hello
And I thank you very much
But you spoke so I could understand
And I drew a treasure map on your hand

And you were no picnic
You were no prize
But you had just enough pathos
To keep me hypnotized
Hypnotized

The map led ro an island
In a seas of store-bought dreams
Where soulless singers sang
Over beats built by machines

And lovely girls were hovering
Above my head like gulls
With their long slender necks
And their delicate skulls

And I was no picnic
I was no prize
But I had just enough sweetness
To keep you hypnotized
Hypnotized

So that's how you found me

As I whisper a joy of this pain

You've done it all
You won me over

I'll stop the storm if it rains
I'll light a path far from here
I'll make your fear melt away

All we have is this night to get through
With a twist of your smile your own way
You left me all up in arms and confused

And how this kiss would be wonderfully vain
I swear I'll melt if you touch me at all

A girl collapses on her bed, writing words never read
Troubled youth spills over into troubled life and times
We walk along with our troubled minds

A guitar strikes a chord, hits a misery so hard, so bold
Sounding through this world where it's so hard to feel that gold
It's running through a song of beauty buried deep under a river of greed
Where the muddy waters flow and the stones don't roll

This is for all the unheard, all the music left behind
All the songs left on the floor in the closets of our minds
Where's the passion gone in our hearts, lost somewhere in the grind?
It's time to bring it back, it's time to unwind, find what we lost, it's time
It's time to bring it back

A lost song lingers on
Bouncing off stars on and on
A moment gone, or is it looking for you
To sing its tune?

Troubled youth spills over into troubled life and times
We walk alone with our troubled minds

This is for all the unheard, all the music left behind
All the songs left on the floor in the closets of our minds
Where's the passion gone in our hearts, lost somewhere in the grind?
